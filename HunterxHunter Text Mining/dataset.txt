Departure x And x Friends
Whale Island
Gon's still trying to catch the Lord of the Lake?
Huh?
Y-Yes...
He's been at it for a week, non-stop.
You promised he could take the Hunter Exam
if he caught the Lord of the Lake?
What a fool!
Five adults couldn't manage to
reel in that monster.
How is a child supposed to catch that beast?
Mito-san doesn't want him
taking the Hunter Exam.
But Gon's old man was the same age
when he caught it...
He can't do it.
Got him!
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
I got him good!
It's huge!
This is the Lord of the Lake?
It's been twenty years!
I know! It was Gon's father that time, right?
He's his father's son.
Gon actually caught the Lord!
Look, Mito-san!
Mito-san!
I caught the Lord, as promised...
So I can take the Hunter Exam, right?
Right?
I'll do my best.
I promise to become a Hunter!
It must be in the blood...
No one has been able to catch the Lord
after Ging pulled it off, at the age of twelve.
And now his son has accomplished
the same feat, at the same age.
His eyes have the same shine as his father's.
We can no longer stop him.
Are you sure about this, Gon?
Uh-huh.
Your father abandoned you
when you were still young
to become a Hunter.
I know.
He chose becoming a Hunter over raising you!
Isn't that amazing?
Huh?
Being a Hunter is so great, he was willing
to abandon his own kid!
It's a dangerous job!
You never know when you might lose your life!
Don't you understand?
I don't.
But I want to know more!
I want to become a Hunter and discover why
it was so important to my dad!
You really are Ging's son...
I promise I'll pass the exam.
I'll pass the exam, and I'll become a Hunter!
Just promise that you'll come back safe.
Can you do that?
Uh-huh, I promise!
Pinky swear made...
Whoever breaks their promise has
to swallow a thousand needles.
Sealed with a kiss!
Gon...
Thank you, Mito-san.
Good luck!
Knock 'em dead!
I'm going to become the
best Hunter in the world!
Once I'm the best Hunter
in the world, I'll come back!
The best Hunter in the world?
Kid doesn't respect us.
Every year, there are millions of skilled
applicants for the Hunter Exam.
But only a handful are selected.
Don't say stuff that you can't back up, boy.
What are you doing, Katsuo?
At this rate, you'll never make a decent sailor.
Why are you bent over?
Hey, losers!
Don't slack off!
A-Aye, sir!
Hey...
Didn't you hear me?
Move that box!
A-Aye, Captain!
Hold on.
Thanks!
A storm's coming.
How can you tell, boy?
That's what the seagulls are saying.
What?
Plus...
It's a huge storm that's coming!
It's true...
I can tell by the smell!
That boy...
Those eyes...
Could he be...
Captain!
The mast won't last much longer!
We should lower the sails!
Don't be stupid!
The fun's about to start.
Here we go!
Full to port!
Let's fly!
Hunter Vocabulary
Gon
Those waves weren't much...
Hey, take the helm.
A-Aye!
Damn, this is one lousy crew.
Not a one of them can stand.
Pathetic.
And they're supposed to be
taking the Hunter Examination.
What a laugh!
Here are some herbs.
If you chew them, you'll feel a little better.
W-Water...
It's coming, so hold on.
That boy...
This is one sour apple...
I see.
There are a few tough nuts on board.
Excuse me!
H-Here is your water!
Thanks.
Now drink your fill.
Thanks. I really appreciate it, Katsuo-san.
First, tell me your names.
I'm Gon!
I'm Kurapika.
It's Leorio.
Why do you want to become Hunters?
Hey! If you're not an examiner,
you can't boss us around!
Just answer the question!
My dad is a Hunter.
I left Whale Island because I want to know
why my dad desired so much to be a Hunter.
Whale Island...
So this is Ging's son.
The day has finally come.
Hey, kid!
Huh?
You're not supposed to answer his question!
Why can't I tell him why I'm here?
Not a team player, huh?
I don't wish to reveal why I'm here.
I agree with Leorio.
What?
Hey! Aren't you younger than I am?
Show some respect!
It's quite simple to avoid pesky questions
by offering a plausible lie.
Hey! Are you listening to me?
However, it is quite shameful to rely upon deceit.
That said, if I were to tell you the truth,
I would be exposing my deepest secrets.
That is why I cannot provide an answer.
Hey, you... Don't ignore me!
In other words,
you refuse to answer my question.
Hey, Katsuo.
Aye, Captain.
Tell the examination board that
we have two more dropouts.
What do you mean?
You still haven't figured it out?
The Hunter Examination has already begun.
What?
There are as many Hunter wannabes
as there are stars in the sky.
The examiners don't have the time or
resources to review them all.
So they hire people like us, to trim the fat.
I've already notified the board
that everyone else on this ship had to withdraw.
If they couldn't handle a little storm,
they'd stand no chance in the
Hunter Examination's later stages.
In other words, you only proceed to
the main exam if I pass you.
So think carefully before you answer my question.
So he says...
Should have told us sooner.
I am the last survivor of the Kurta Clan.
Four years ago, my clan was annihilated
by a band of criminals.
I wish to become a Hunter and
hunt down that band,
the Phantom Troupe.
So you want to become a bounty hunter?
The Phantom Troupe is a Class-A bounty.
Not even the most grizzled Hunters
can touch them.
You'd be throwing away your life.
I do not fear death.
I fear only that my rage
will fade over time.
So, in other words, you want revenge.
Does that require that you become a Hunter?
That may be the stupidest question
I've ever heard, Leorio.
That's Leorio-san to you!
Places accessible only to Hunters...
Information otherwise unobtainable...
Actions otherwise impossible...
There are more reasons than your
brain could possibly handle.
Hey!
Why do you want to become a Hunter, Leorio-san?
Me?
I'll make it short.
I want money.
Money can get you everything!
A big house!
A nice car!
Good liquor!
You can't buy class with money, Leorio.
That's three times now.
Step outside.
I'll end the filthy Kurta bloodline, here and now.
Take that back, Leorio!
Take that back!
That's Leorio-san to you.
Hey, boys!
I'm not finished yet!
Just let them go.
Huh?
Mito-san once told me...
If you want to get to know someone,
you need to make an effort
to learn why they're angry.
It's important for them to
understand why they're mad.
So we should let them settle it themselves.
Captain!
L-Look...
If we get caught by that waterspout,
the ship will sink.
Lower the sails now.
Aye!
I'll help!
Uh-huh, come with me.
I'll take the helm.
Aye!
Full to starboard!
Hurry!
The waterspout is gonna catch us!
Take back what you said!
Take back your words,
and I'll forgive you, Leorio.
How many times must I repeat myself?
You should show me some respect.
I won't back down.
Then I have no choice...
Katsuo-san!
Damn it!
Pull 'em out! Now...
You idiot!
If we hadn't grabbed your legs,
you'd be shark bait now.
Honestly...
How reckless can you be?
But you did catch me.
Huh?
You both caught me!
Well, I guess so...
Gon!
Katsuo-san!
Thanks, Gon!
You saved my life.
I couldn't have done it alone.
These two helped save you.
Huh?
Thank you very much!
No, you don't need to thank me.
Well...
Yeah, I'm glad you're okay.
Yeah! So I'll be returning to my station!
What?
I apologize for my rude behavior.
Sorry, Leorio-san.
Wh-What's with the sudden change?
We sound like strangers...
Just call me Leorio... Leorio works.
I'm also sorry.
I take back everything I said.
I was wrong.
No, it's okay.
I like you guys!
Okay!
I'll take responsibility for bringing
you three to the port closest to the exam site.
Really?
What about your test?
Like I said...
It's my decision to make.
And all three of you pass!
Yay!
And so began Gon's journey...
To follow in his father's footsteps
and become a Hunter.
Next time: Test x Of x Tests.
Look forward to it!

Dolle Harbor
After winning the captain's favor,
the trio of Gon, Kurapika, and Leorio
arrived safely at Dolle Harbor.
Thanks, Captain!
I had a great time!
I had fun, too.
Right! As a token of my appreciation,
I'll give you some advice.
Advice?
Look. See that big cedar tree on the hilltop?
Uh-huh.
You should make your way there first.
It's a shortcut to the exam site.
A shortcut?
Got it!
So, I just need to head for that tree!
I'll do that, Captain!
Thanks!
Best of luck!
Yep! Same to you!
Take care!
Rest easy, Ging.
Your son has grown into a respectable young man.
Huh... That's strange.
Why?
According to the notice I received,
the exam is supposedly being held
somewhere in Zaban City.
Right now, we're here.
That tree is in the opposite direction.
Perhaps you misheard him?
No, he told me to head toward that cedar tree.
I see...
And this notice isn't any help!
Where, exactly, in Zaban City
are we meant to go?
Our task is to find the exam site,
using a limited amount of information.
Just another test before we'll be allowed
to take the Hunter Exam.
I-I knew that...
I already knew that!
Anyway, I'll go have a look.
The captain must have had
a reason to suggest that.
Hey, hey...
You're serious?
The bus to Zaban is about to leave.
We should just take it.
Hey!
Man...
He's gotta learn that you
can't trust everyone.
Huh?
Hey!
Kurapika!
Gon's behavior interests me more
than the captain's advice.
I'm going with him.
Oh, is that so?
See ya.
Wasn't very long... Nice knowing you.
Guess he's not as independent as I'd thought...
I'm just gonna take the bus!
So it was a trap...
Seems none of the buses have
made it to Zaban City.
Rookies usually fail this part
because they're too naïve.
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait for me!
Well, I knew you guys would
be lonely without me.
And it's no fun traveling alone.
So I decided to stick with you
guys a while longer.
This is a creepy place...
I don't see a single person.
No, there are plenty here.
What?
Wh-What's with the freak show?
Exciting...
E-Exciting?
Exciting...
Exciting.
Exciting two-choice quiz!
You boys are headed for that
tree on the hill, correct?
To reach that tree,
you must pass through this town.
Huh?
I shall administer a single-question quiz.
H-Hold on!
What's going on here?
You'll have five seconds to state your answer.
Give the wrong answer, and you're disqualified.
You'll have to give up on taking
this year's Hunter Exam.
I see...
Then this is part of the Hunter Exam.
I see how it is.
I happen to be a quiz expert.
Wait. Only one question?
Your answer will be either the number 1 or 2.
Any other answer will be considered incorrect.
Hold on!
All three of us share one question?
So if one of them answers incorrectly,
I'm disqualified, too?
As if that would happen!
What scares me is the high likelihood
of the vice versa happening.
What was that?
But you know...
This way's easier, since only one of us
needs to know the answer.
I'm not good at quizzes.
I suppose...
Fair point.
Hey, there. Hurry it up.
Or else I'll answer the question first.
Who are you?
He followed us here, all the way from port.
Huh? Seriously?
Sorry, kid.
I happened to overhear your conversation.
What will you do?
He seems eager to take it.
We should let him go first.
That way, we'll know what kind
of question to expect.
I don't mind.
I have no objection.
Then I'll get to it.
Fools.
I'll leave a trail of traps behind me.
Here is your question...
Evil villains have captured your mother and lover.
You can only save one.
Select 1 for your mother, or 2 for your lover.
Which will you save?
H-How is this even a quiz?
The answer is 1.
Oh? Why do you say that?
Because you can't replace your mother.
But you can find another lover.
What?
You may pass.
What?
You just have to tell the old lady
what she wants to hear.
Adios.
Hey, now! That's all bull!
How was that the right answer?
We're supposed to give the answer
the old lady wants?
And that's considered correct?
Hey, say something!
I won't put up with this sham.
I'll find a different route.
It's too late.
Refuse to take the quiz, and you're disqualified.
Th-That's just ridiculous!
Different people would expect different answers!
There is no right answer!
No right answer...
I see!
Leorio!
Wait!
The cat-eyed boy has figured it out.
Not another word from you.
Say anything but the answer,
and you're immediately disqualified.
Wake up, Leorio...
It's a simple trick...
Gon...
Here is your question...
Your son and daughter have been kidnapped.
You can only rescue one.
Select 1 for your son, or 2 for your daughter.
Which will you rescue?
She's making fun of us...
Five.
Go ahead and count down, you hag.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
Buzz. Time's up.
Don't stop me, Kurapika!
I won't be satisfied until I've
taught this hag a lesson!
Calm down, Leorio!
How am I supposed to calm down?
You'll waste our correct response.
Correct response?
We gave the right answer.
Silence was the correct response.
Silence? What do you mean...
You hit the nail on the head.
There is no right answer!
Precisely.
This quiz had no right answer.
However, we could only state
1 or 2 as the answer.
In other words, we weren't meant
to respond at all.
Silence was the only response.
But what about that other guy?
They never said he gave the right answer.
She only said, "You may pass."
In other words, this path is the wrong path.
Am I right?
Precisely.
The correct path is over here.
This leads directly to the tree.
Walk two hours, and you'll reach the top.
Oh, so that's what this was about...
A couple lives in the cabin beneath that tree.
They serve as Navigators.
If you meet their standards, I believe that
they will guide you to the exam site.
Gran, I'm sorry for my rudeness.
Don't be. I don't mind.
I do this job because I enjoy
meeting people like you.
Huh?
Do your best to become a good Hunter.
It's no use. I can't think of an answer.
You were still trying to find an answer?
You can stop.
Huh? Why?
The quiz is over.
I know.
But...
But you know...
What if I run into a situation like that
and I can only save one person...
What should I do then?
It wouldn't be right to choose just one...
But one day, I might have
to make that choice.
That's right.
That is the true purpose of this test.
You must be prepared to face the
worst possible scenarios...
Because harsh reality strikes without warning.
You must be prepared for
the day your paths diverge.
Hunter Vocabulary
Kurapika
It's totally dark out...
"Walk two hours," she said?
It was two hours, two hours ago!
Damn.
Beware of Magical Beasts!
Another "Beware of Magical Beasts" sign?
Are we ever gonna make it to the exam site?
I'm hungry!
I need to take a dump!
Leorio!
We'll leave you behind!
I've gotta take a leak, too!
I see it.
Hey!
Hello? Anyone home?
Are they out?
We're coming in.
It's a Magical Beast!
A Magical Beast?
A Transforming Magical Beast, the Kiriko!
They can take human form!
That's an extremely intelligent creature!
There's a woman in his arms!
And the guy on the floor
needs medical attention...
P-Please...
Please save my wife...
Leorio, we'll leave the injured man to you!
Got it!
He can follow that faint shadow,
even through this dark forest.
Impressive.
Kiriko! Let her go!
Take her from me, if you can!
Wow! He can talk!
That Magical Beast,
the Kiriko, uses human speech.
Oh. That makes this a lot easier!
Hey! Silly Kiriko!
What?
H-He's fast!
Kurapika!
He's so reckless...
Stupid kid.
You'll pay for this!
Wait!
Are you okay?
Are you injured anywhere?
I'm okay.
What about my husband?
How is he?
Don't worry.
Our friend is taking care of him.
Please take me to my husband!
Those tattoos...
You're...
Kurapika!
You okay?
Leorio?
Whew... Guess you guys are all right.
How is that man?
Yeah, no worries.
The wound wasn't as deep as it looked.
I gave him some painkillers,
and he's sound asleep in the cabin.
I see...
How did you know?
How did you know I was an impostor?
I didn't think that you were.
I told Leorio to take care of the
injured man, and he consented.
Given the Magical Beast is still on the loose,
I attacked you for foolishly leaving
an injured man on his own.
That's all.
Now I need you to answer my question.
Who are you?
Wait!
For a kid, you're pretty quick.
Didn't expect you'd land a blow on me.
You're about to discover
the high price that accomplishment came with!
Who are you?
You aren't the one I hit.
Are you his friend?
How can you tell that I'm not the same one?
Huh?
Your face is completely different.
And your voice is a little higher and thinner.
What?
Did I say something funny?
Hey, sweetheart!
Come out here!
You're gonna love this!
Hmm...
How many years has it been since someone
was able to tell us apart?
I'm ecstatic!
Can you tell their faces and
voices are different?
No, not at all...
You see, the one Kurapika and I
beat up is the husband.
Which one are you talking about?
Allow us to introduce ourselves.
We are the Navigators.
Our family provides support
for the Hunter Exam.
I'm their daughter!
I'm their son!
Man, you had us fooled.
The Hunter Exam changes site every year.
It's quite difficult to locate it.
So we Navigators help by guiding
the applicants to the site.
Oh, that's how it works.
But we don't help every candidate.
We test applicants to see if they're qualified
to take the exam.
Kurapika-dono.
Yes.
You successfully used the most vague of hints
to determine that we weren't spouses.
The hint was these tattoos
which, in this region,
mark a woman as single for life.
Kurapika-dono demonstrated that
he is very knowledgeable.
Therefore, he passes.
Way to go, Kurapika.
Thanks.
Leorio-dono.
Yeah...
You never realized my true identity.
However, you dressed my injuries
faster and more thoroughly than any doctor.
Most importantly, you continued
to reassure me
that my wife was safe.
S-Stop it...
It's embarrassing...
Your kindness makes you worthy
to take the Hunter Exam.
Thus, you pass.
R-Really?
Thank goodness...
You did it!
And finally, Gon-dono.
Yes!
Your superhuman physical ability
and powers of observation
make you worthy to take the Hunter Exam.
You pass.
We will now take you to the exam site.
Isn't it great that we all passed?
It's too early to celebrate.
We've merely earned the right
to take the real exam.
What's wrong with celebrating a little?
We're making progress.
Honestly, you people really should think.
Hey! Why must you be such a smart-ass?
Stop moving around!
If you fall, blame yourself!
Gon and his friends enjoy a brief
journey through the sky.
However, they still haven't reached
the starting line.

Rivals x For x Survival
Zaban City
Gon and his new friends have arrived in Zaban City,
site of the Hunter Exam,
aided by the Kiriko Navigators.
As Navigators, our job is to identify
worthy Hunter applicants
and guide them to the exam site.
In other words, it would be extremely
difficult for someone to reach the site
without a Navigator's help.
Hey, wanna try one?
It's Zaban's famous panda-frog-on-a-stick!
A true delicacy!
This brooch was excavated from
Zaban's underground palace.
I bet that it's a national treasure.
You know, Zaban City is quite a shady place.
Prosperous cities tend to attract
all sorts of nasty types.
What are you doing, Gon?
We're going!
Yeah!
I believe
that is the building.
Huh?
It's so tall!
They have a really nice building.
So this is the exam site...
This is what draws...
Hunter applicants from across the world.
My first shot at the Hunter Exam...
Was this how Dad felt, when he first arrived?
Hey, guys!
Hmm?
Over here.
What?
Here.
Wait, this isn't funny.
Isn't that an ordinary restaurant?
You can't possibly mean that Hunter
applicants from around the world
are meant to assemble here?
I do.
Huh?
No one would ever expect the Hunter Exam,
with its millions of candidates,
to be located here, right?
That's true.
Welcome!
Is the back room open?
What will you have?
The steak combo that opens
your eyes to the light.
For three.
For three...
How would you like them?
Grilled over a low flame, until cooked.
Got it. Let yourself into the back room.
Wait here.
Wait?
Where are the others?
I can't wait for the steak combo.
Gon, that was just the password
to get us inside.
Oh, we don't get to eat?
One in every ten thousand...
Hmm?
The number of applicants
who make it this far.
You've done extremely well for first-timers.
Well, good luck.
Thanks!
I would be happy to serve as your
Navigator next year, as well.
What?
It appears this room is an elevator.
Bastard...
That meant that he expects us
to fail this year.
Once every three years.
What's that?
The frequency with which a
rookie passes the exam.
Huh?
It's that unusual?
Some cannot endure
the exam's physical and mental strain.
It's also not unusual for veterans
to break the rookies,
who consequently never retake the test.
So I guess candidates are willing to risk
everything to become Hunters.
But of course, my friend!
Hunters make the most money in this world!
No!
Hunters are the most noble in this world.
Glory hog...
Money grubber!
Gon! Listen...
Every year, over fifty Hunters
make the list of the world's
hundred richest people!
Hunters are associated with
hunting wild game and treasure,
but they are all second-rate.
True Hunters work to protect
people and the natural order.
Now, look here...
Once you're a Hunter, most countries
will give you a free pass!
And no charge to use public facilities.
How are those benefits?
Hunters have many difficult and
important responsibilities,
such as preserving cultural artifacts
and endangered species,
as well as capturing wanted criminals
and unscrupulous Hunters.
The fame and money...
That's why people wish to become Hunters!
Profound knowledge, a healthy mind and body,
and unyielding conviction...
Those are the qualities on which
Hunters pride themselves!
Gon! What do you think?
Which kind of Hunter do you
hope to become?!
Well, when you put it that way...
I think we've arrived.
We'll continue this later.
Strange atmosphere down here.
They clearly differ from the
Hunter applicants we saw
at the port and in the city.
Each is a master, in their own right...
Excuse me...
Everyone's really tense.
Hello. Please take a number.
Here you go.
Here.
Be sure you wear this on
your chest at all times.
Be careful not to lose it.
Haven't seen you guys around before.
Yo.
You can tell we're new?
More or less.
After all, this will be my thirty-fifth attempt.
Thirty-five times?!
Well, you could say I'm an exam veteran.
That isn't something to brag about.
Indeed.
If you have any questions,
feel free to ask me.
Thank you.
My name is Tonpa.
I'm Gon.
These are Kurapika and Leorio.
Hey, are there others who
have taken the exam a bunch
of times like you?
Well, I have the most experience here,
but there are a few others.
For instance, there's him...
Number 255,
Todo, the wrestler.
He's unmatched in strength.
And he's smarter than he looks.
On the other side, we have number 103,
Bourbon, the snake charmer.
He tends to hold grudges,
so you don't want to end up on his bad side.
And then...
Number 191, Bodoro,
the kung fu master.
He's getting old, but there still isn't
a better martial artist around.
Then you have the three brothers,
Amori, Imori, and Umori.
They perform consistently well,
thanks to their excellent teamwork.
And number 384, Gerreta,
the huntsman.
He specializes in killing
all manner of creatures,
by blow dart and club.
There are many more,
but they have taken the test
the most times.
Ah...
Oh, how peculiar...
His arms seem to have become flower petals.
No smoke and mirrors here.
Do take care.
When you bump into someone,
you really should apologize.
That psychopath is back again.
Again?
Does that mean he took last year's exam?
Number 44. Hisoka, the magician.
Last year, he was a virtual
lock to pass the test,
until he all but killed an examiner he didn't like.
A-And they're still allowing him to
retake the exam this year?
Of course.
Every year, the examiners and
test content change,
and the examiners are the ones
who choose the new content.
The devil himself could pass if that were
the examiners' determination.
That's just how the Hunter Exam works.
Anyway, no one likes him.
You should stay away, too.
He looks dangerous.
That much is for sure.
Oh, right...
A little something to mark our acquaintance.
How about it?
Oh, appreciated.
As it happened, I was thirsty...
Thanks!
Thank you.
There he goes.
He always plays the nice guy,
despite being nastier than
anyone else here.
Tonpa, the rookie crusher...
Best of luck to all of us!
The juice I gave you contains an
extremely strong laxative.
One sip, and for three days,
your guts will be a non-stop roller coaster.
You'll need diapers to take the exam.
Hunter Vocabulary
Leorio
Tonpa-san, this juice must have expired.
It tastes funny.
Seriously?
That was close!
H-Huh? That's strange...
Impossible!
That laxative should have
practically no taste nor scent.
I'm very sorry!
I didn't realize the juice had gone bad.
It's okay. You don't have to apologize.
Is your stomach okay?
Y-Yes... I'm fine.
I've sampled all kinds of mountain
grasses and plants.
So I can usually taste when something's bad.
R-Really?
That's amazing...
Damn... I had to run into
this wild mountain kid.
Sorry about that again.
I'll see you around.
Talkative old man...
Still, there's something wrong
with this year's rookies.
That number 294, Hanzo, too.
He seemed gullible when I approached him.
Don't tell anyone else,
but I'm actually a ninja.
Huh?
Oh, really?
I seek the legendary scroll... Shh...
The Ultimate Ninja Scroll.
That is why I desire to become a Hunter.
I've heard that it's hidden somewhere
inaccessible to ordinary people.
Anyway, it's boring here...
Yeah, I guess... So, how about it?
Let's toast our new friendship.
As a ninja, I make it a point
to never drink anything someone else offers.
Sorry.
I-I see...
I could tell by his eyes that he's no fool.
One false step, and I could've
been in real danger.
Speaking of danger, there's number 301...
That guy just oozes peril.
I can't even go near him.
Then there's that guy I can't stand,
number 187, Nicolas.
Must've been tough to make it here.
Not really. Everything went
as predicted by my data...
I used historical data,
from past Hunter Exams,
to calculate this year's location.
Quite simple.
Frankly, I was bored senseless.
R-Really... That's amazing.
My name is Tonpa. Nice to meet you.
Tonpa-san, is it?
Oh, there you are.
This is your thirty-fifth attempt,
the second-highest number by one person.
And with thirty, you have the most
consecutive appearances.
Very impressive.
Please, it's no big deal.
How about it?
Let's drink to our new friendship...
But you have yet to actually pass the exam.
I assume that's because
you're too absorbed by your other objective.
Eh?
Tonpa-san, the rookie crusher.
What?
Well, I won't share my knowledge
with anyone else,
seeing as you hold the consecutive
appearance record...
Goodbye.
Bastard... Just you wait.
I'll break that snotty nose of yours.
Hey, Tonpa-san!
Could I have more of that juice?
Must be my nerves.
I'm really thirsty.
Eh?
Oh, sure...
What the hell?
The laxative he drank earlier should
have taken effect by now.
What's going on?
It's only a laxative,
but if he imbibes that much,
he could die of dehydration.
Worried?
I'll be fine. I've trained.
Poisons won't affect me.
Poisons?
He knew what was in the juice?
But he still drank it?
Number 99, Killua.
This year's rookies are all insane...
Well, it doesn't matter.
That just means crushing them will
be all the more worthwhile.
I apologize for the wait.
The entry period for
Hunter applicants has ended.
The Hunter Exam will now begin!
A final caution.
If you are short on luck or ability,
you could very well end up
seriously injured or even dead.
Those who accept the risks,
please follow me.
Otherwise, please exit via
the elevator behind you.
Very well.
All 404 applicants will participate in Phase One.
Of course, no one turned around and left.
I'd hoped a few might withdraw.
Wh-What?
The people in front started running.
He's picked up the pace.
I neglected to introduce myself.
I am Satotz, the Phase One examiner.
I shall lead you to the exam's Second Phase.
Second Phase?
What about Phase One?
It has already commenced.
It's already begun?
This is part of the test?
You must follow me to Phase Two.
This is the exam's First Phase.
Follow you? That's it?
Yes.
I cannot tell you where or
when you must arrive.
You need to follow me.
I see how it is.
This test is weird.
I expect it's an endurance test.
Fine by me.
I'll be right behind you!
But there is the mental stress
of not knowing
how far we'll have to run.
He's also testing our mental fortitude.
The exam's First Phase begins,
amidst a mix of warriors and knaves.
One candidate is disqualified
before it even starts.
The total number of Hunter
applicants is 404.
Next time: Hope x And x Ambition.
Time to go fishin'!
Yeah!
﻿Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
The word "unknown" holds magic.
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.
They are known...
...as Hunters!
The Hunter Exam will now begin!
I am Satotz, the Phase One examiner.
You must follow me to Phase Two.
This is the exam's First Phase.
Hope x And x Ambition
Two hours have passed since
the start of the exam.
The applicants have traveled
over thirty kilometers from the start.
None of them knows how far they must go.
They are forced to run at the leader's pace,
with no goal specified.
It's a monotonous course with no end in sight.
And many applicants have
already dropped out.
Extrapolating from historical data,
this exam type usually
involves a forty-kilometer course.
My calculations suggest that
we are nearing the goal...
I underestimated the Hunter Exam.
Every person here is a monster.
It's a gathering of monsters...
Hey! Wait up, kid!
Hmm?
You should show the
Hunter Exam some respect!
What do you mean?
Why are you using a skateboard?
That's cheating!
Why?
Why...
This is an endurance test!
No, it isn't.
Huh?
Gon, what are you saying?
The examiner only told us to follow him.
Whose side are you on, eh?
Hey, how old are you?
I'm twelve years old.
Hmm...
We're the same age.
Huh?
Guess I'll run too.
Wow!
That was cool!
I'm Killua.
I'm Gon.
Damn it...
Making a fool out of me...
Impossible.
It's impossible!
My calculations are never wrong!
So why...
Am I... going to fail?
For me to fail...
That's absurd.
Unthinkable!
I won't accept that!
Hey, rookie!
You're a mess.
It's rare to see someone
out of steam so early.
You must be a hell of an incompetent.
People like you are doomed
to fail the Hunter Exam.
So don't come back, snotrag!
Here. Thanks.
Great work.
He won't recover from the abuse
we just dished out.
I doubt he'll ever take the
Hunter Exam again.
Anyway, Tonpa...
You really do love crushing rookies.
I live for it.
It's been about four hours since the exam began.
We must have traveled at least sixty kilometers.
How much farther do we need to go?
Only one rookie, every three years,
passes the Hunter Exam.
So for a normal human like me,
it isn't even worth dreaming about...
Damn it.
Hey, forget him.
Let's get going.
Screw that...
I'm gonna become a Hunter!
Damn it all!
Cool!
Let me try that later.
If you let me try your skateboard, okay?
We've reached the eighty-kilometer mark.
It is now time to pick up the pace a bit.
Wait, are you serious?
That guy's insane.
He's prancing up the stairs,
as if they're not even there.
If he keeps up this pace,
tons of people will fail.
Gon, wanna race to see who finishes first?
Sure.
The loser has to buy dinner.
Okay, you're on!
Ready...
Go!
Leorio, are you okay?
Sure!
Just look at me.
I realized that I can keep going
if I don't worry about how stupid I look!
I should probably follow his example.
Leorio...
I have a question.
What?
Is this too easy for you, Kurapika?
Talking just wastes energy!
Are you really trying to become
a Hunter for the money?
You aren't, right?
We've only been together for a few days,
but I know you better than that.
Sure, you have a nasty attitude,
and you aren't very bright.
But you're not a shallow person.
I've seen many who live for money.
You're nothing like them.
You and your logic...
Scarlet eyes.
That's why the Kurta were targeted.
We Kurta are known for
our unique scarlet eyes.
When our emotions are heightened,
our eyes turn scarlet, as though on fire.
The eyes in that scarlet state
are considered one of the seven most
beautiful colors in the world.
They command high prices
on the black market.
That's why the Phantom Troupe
attacked you?
They took every single eye from
my brethren's corpses.
I can still hear their darkened eyes
crying out in anguish...
I swear I will capture the Phantom Troupe!
And I will reclaim the eyes of my clan!
That's why you want to be a Hunter?
Yeah, if I become a Hunter with rich clients,
I'll gain access to black market information.
But you'll have to swallow your pride
and become the kind of Hunter you despise!
The blow to my pride is nothing,
measured against the suffering
my clan endured.
Sorry, but I have no noble cause.
Huh?
I'm just after money.
Don't lie!
I'm not lying!
You really believe you can buy
everything with money?
You bet!
For the right price, you can buy not only
treasures, but dreams, hearts,
and even people's lives!
Take that back, Leorio!
If you're insulting the Kurta,
I won't forgive you.
Why? I'm telling the truth.
If I'd had money, my friend
wouldn't have died!
An illness?
It was a treatable disease...
The problem was that the
operation costs a fortune.
I was naïve!
I thought I could become a doctor...
I wanted to cure kids who have
the same disease,
and be able to tell them
it was free of charge!
Then I could have told his parents, too.
That was my dream...
What a joke.
Turns out that to become a doctor,
you need even more money!
Got it?
The world runs on money...
So I want money!
See you at the goal, Kurapika.
Catch you later, old timer.
I'm not old!
I'm a teenager, just like you guys!
Huh?
No way!
Hunter Vocabulary
Killua
Can't take another step...
Th-This is it...
I'm impressed that you
can keep up with me.
Really?
Or maybe it's just that
everyone else is too slow.
Man...
The Hunter Exam is gonna be a breeze.
That's no fun.
Hey, why do you want to
become a Hunter?
Me?
I'm not really interested in
becoming a Hunter.
Huh?
I heard the exam was supposed
to be really hard,
so I thought it'd be fun.
But this is disappointing.
What about you?
Well, my dad's a Hunter.
So I want to become a Hunter, like my dad.
Hmm...
What kind of Hunter is he?
I don't know.
That's kinda weird.
Really?
You want to be like your dad,
but you don't know anything about him?
I was raised by Mito-san,
so I've only seen my dad in pictures.
Who's Mito-san?
Aunt Mito.
Oh...
When he was twelve,
my dad took the Hunter Exam.
He passed and became a Hunter.
Then he left the island.
I want to find out why he
chose to be a Hunter
over being with me.
The exit!
Whew...
Finally, I can get out of this dark tunnel!
Now, let's see how many made it this far.
Goal!
Yay! I win.
What are you talking about?
I was faster...
I was.
No, I was!
I was faster, so you have to buy dinner!
Nope!
I was faster.
So you buy me dinner.
But I was faster.
Hey, who was faster?
I believe that you crossed the
finish line simultaneously.
Oh...
Then I'll buy you dinner.
Huh?
Then you buy me dinner!
I don't get it.
Hey, Satotz-san.
Is this where the Second Phase
of the exam takes place?
No, we still have quite a way to go.
Oh...
Hey, Kurapika!
Is this our destination?
No, it isn't.
I see.
The fog is fading.
Really?
The Numere Wetlands,
also known as Swindlers Swamp.
We must cross these wetlands to
reach Phase Two of the exam.
This place is home to many bizarre animals,
many of them being cunning, insatiable creatures
who deceive humans and prey upon them.
Be very careful.
If you let them fool you...
...you're dead.
Wait for me!
These wetland creatures will use
every trick in the book to fool their prey.
An ecosystem in which creatures
obtain food through deceit...
Hence the name Swindlers Swamp.
Stay very close to me so you won't be deceived.
What a joke.
How can they fool us,
when we're expecting it?
Don't let them fool you!
I just said that they can't.
D-Don't fall for it...
He's lying to you!
He's an impostor!
He isn't an examiner...
I'm the real examiner.
An impostor?
What's going on?
Then who is he?
Look at this...
He looks just like Satotz-san!
It's a Man-Faced Ape, one of the creatures
that dwell in the Numere Wetlands!
A Man-Faced Ape?
Man-Faced Apes love the taste
of fresh human flesh.
However, their limbs are long and thin,
so they're quite weak.
That's why they disguise themselves as humans.
They trick humans into following them
into these wetlands,
where they team up with other animals
to kill and devour them.
He intends to trap every single applicant!
Bastard...
He certainly doesn't walk like a human...
Huh?
I see, I see...
That settles it...
You're the real one.
What? He's the real examiner?
Huh?
Examiners are Hunters
selected by the committee to perform
this duty without pay.
Any Hunter, bearing the title we seek,
would have been able to block that attack.
I shall take that as a compliment.
However, should you attack me again,
for any reason,
I will report you for turning
on an examiner.
And you will be immediately disqualified.
Are we clear?
Sure.
Nature really can be brutal to watch...
So he was a Man-Faced Ape, as well.
He was attempting to confuse
the applicants,
to lure some of them away.
We cannot relax our guard.
Yeah.
You will be encountering such
deception on a regular basis.
I believe that a number of you
were fooled into suspecting my identity?
Do you understand?
If you lose sight of me in
the Numere Wetlands fog,
you will never reach the exam's Second Phase.
Do bear that in mind.
Then let us be on our way.
Please follow me.
Tsk, another marathon.
And we're running through marsh this time.
Running on wet ground requires more energy.
The applicants have finally escaped
the long, dark tunnel.
Thus far, 36 candidates have
withdrawn from the exam,
leaving 368 remaining applicants.
Their next challenge is the Numere Wetlands,
also known as Swindlers Swamp.
The brutal Hunter Exam continues.
Next time: Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!
Okey-dokey!
﻿Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

I will report you for turning

And you will be immediately disqualified.
Are we clear?
Sure.
Hisoka x Is x Sneaky
The 368 applicants who made it through
the long underground tunnel
find themselves in an unexplored land
teeming with strange creatures,
known as the Numere Wetlands.
Pay attention now.
Be sure to stay close behind me.
The fog is getting thicker.
All right...
This is our chance.
We'll take advantage of the fog
to get rid of him!
Gon...
Huh?
Let's move up.
Okay.
We don't want to lose sight
of the examiner.
I'm more concerned with
increasing the distance between
us and Hisoka.
Staying too close to him is dangerous.
I can smell it in the air.
Smell?
Hmm...
I don't think he smells.
Leorio! Kurapika!
Killua says that we should move up!
Hey...
Can't you feel the tension
surrounding us?
Moron!
If I had the strength,
I'd already be there!
Don't worry about us!
What?
Let's go, Gon.
Ah, wait!
We can't even tell
which way we're going.
It's okay.
As long as we don't lose sight
of the guys ahead of us...
What's going on?
Wh-What?
Noggin Luggin' Tortoise
This looks bad...
Claymore Mushrooms
Huh? What?
A butterfly?
Hypnosis Butterfly
Damn!
Which way are we supposed to go?
Did we lose sight of him?
Pay attention now.
Be sure to stay close behind me.
Over there!
Pay attention now.
Caw!
Be sure to stay close behind me.
Ruse Raven
Caw!
That thing can imitate human speech?
Close call...
Yeah...
I hear people screaming all around us.
Just stay on your guard.
I wonder if Leorio and
Kurapika are okay...
Mm?
Frog-in-Waiting
Leorio!
Ouch.
Leorio, here's our opportunity.
Y-Yeah...
Guess he didn't like the taste of us.
It was this.
That was from Tonpa-san!
Guess he saved us.
Well, I could have escaped.
I'm still worried about Leorio and Kurapika.
Forget about them. Let's get a move on.
We can still catch up to the examiner.
We've lost sight of the front-runners.
Which way should we go?
Stop!
Over there...
When I saw you last year,
I knew you weren't Hunter material.
We'll spare you if you swear not to
take the Hunter Exam again.
Sure.
Huh?
I'm passing the exam this year,
so I won't need to retake it.
Passing?
Idiot!
Look at this fog.
It's impossible to determine which
direction the main pack went!
Meaning we've all failed the exam!
So that's why.
Having already failed, you wish
to play examiner.
Hunters require prey.
Why don't I play examiner...
And judge whether you
are Hunter material?
Shut up!
Now, then...
H-H-Help!
Hel—
Well?
Care to participate,
in my little game of examiner?
Hunter Vocabulary
Satotz
Cool...
We've caught up to the
main group, Gon.
Huh?
Where'd he go?
Leorio.
On my signal, we run in
opposite directions.
What?
He is vastly more experienced
in real combat.
The two of us won't stand a
chance against him.
We cannot afford to squander time
in a pointless fight!
Now!
I see...
A wise decision.
Hmm?
I just can't do it...
This may not be my fight,
but I won't close my eyes
and make a break for it!
Leorio?!
Mm, I adore that look on your face.
What?
Gon?
I made it in time...
Not bad, little boy.
Is that a fishing pole?
What a fascinating weapon.
Allow me a closer look.
Your fight is with
me!
You came to rescue your friend?
Such a good boy.
And that expression...
Nice...
Very nice.
I'm getting excited now...
Okay!
How wonderful...
I really do love that look.
Do not fear.
I will not kill your friend.
He passed.
Yes, you pass, as well.
Grow up and become a fine Hunter.
Hisoka, you should get back here.
We're nearly at the Phase Two site.
Okay, I'll be right there.
It's always good to have friends.
You can find your own way back, yes?
That's a good boy.
Gon!
Are you all right?
Huh?
Gon isn't here...
This way.
You can really tell?
Uh-huh.
Leorio's cologne is very unique.
I can smell him from a
few kilometers away.
Say, Kurapika...
What did Hisoka mean when
he said that we passed?
Hisoka was acting as a judge.
A judge?
Yes.
He must have his own benchmarks
for evaluating power.
It's possible that he was ascertaining
each applicant's strength.
Apparently, you and Leorio must
have met his standards.
I see.
But I was powerless to do
anything against him.
Didn't you land your first hit on him?
Only because I surprised him.
Besides, Leorio passed,
even though he lost...
Hmm...
Perhaps he sensed that you
were kindred spirits.
Kindred spirits?
I seriously doubt that Hisoka
could qualify as a Hunter.
However,
I must admit that he did impress me
with his superhuman agility
and graceful technique.
It's quite common that those
possessing special talents are drawn
to others with unique gifts.
Most likely, Hisoka's instincts
and experience
told him that you had the skill and
potential to become Hunters.
Killing you now would have been a waste...
That was his perspective.
Oh, I'm sorry!
Was that insensitive on my part?
No...
But I was pretty excited, as well.
I was so scared, I wanted to run away.
But I couldn't.
And at the same time, I was excited.
Isn't that strange?
For the first time in his life,
Gon has experienced mortal fear.
Though the unfamiliar feelings
accompanying that fear confuse Gon,
he cannot restrain his growing curiosity.
At this stage, 220 candidates have
withdrawn from the exam,
leaving 148 remaining applicants.
Next time: A x Surprising x Challenge!
S-Surprisingly challenging.
Huh?
Gon, are you okay?
﻿Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

But I couldn't.
And at the same time, I was excited.
Isn't that strange?
A x Surprising x Challenge
Looks like we made it in time.
Leorio...
Leorio!
Man, that stings...
Why am I all beat up?
Huh?
My memory is kinda hazy.
We probably shouldn't tell
him what happened.
Yeah...
Gon.
Killua!
I can't believe you actually got here...
I thought you were done for.
I just tracked Leorio's cologne.
Cologne?
That was how?
You definitely are weird.
Excellent work, everyone.
Phase Two of the exam will occur here,
in the Biska Forest Park.
So, I shall take my leave.
Best of luck to all of you.
Will all applicants who passed
the First Phase please enter?
Welcome.
I'm Menchi, the Second Phase examiner.
And I'm Buhara, the other examiner.
Wh-What was that sound?
You must be hungry.
I'm starving...
There you have it.
Phase Two will involve...
...cooking!
C-Cooking?
Wait! Cooking?
We're here to take the Hunter Exam!
That's quite right.
Your challenge for the Second Phase is to produce
a dish that will satisfy our palate.
Why do we have to cook?!
That's because
we are Gourmet Hunters.
Huh?
Man, what a letdown.
They're Gourmet Hunters...
The Gourmet Hunters Menchi and Buhara...
Their selection as examiners
could prove problematic.
Only fifty applicants...
No, depending on the task,
it's possible that fewer than ten
applicants will pass Phase Two.
So, Gourmet Hunters,
what are we supposed to make?
Buhara.
The required ingredient is pork.
Pork?
As in pig meat?
You're free to use meat from any
species of Biska Forest pigs.
You must use the cooking facilities here
to prepare the pork.
And you only pass if we both
find it delicious.
And we will evaluate more
than just the taste.
Don't underestimate the
intricacies of cooking.
Got it?
When we've both eaten our fill,
the exam will end.
We get it. We get it.
Let's just start.
Then, the exam's Second Phase
begins now!
Free to use meat from any species of pigs?
You have a real nasty streak.
Choosing the ingredients was my job.
Only one species of pig lives in
the Biska Forest, correct?
I hope they don't get themselves killed.
Hey, little piggy?
Catch a pig and cook it.
This is way easier than the First Phase.
I hope it will be that simple...
What was that about, Gon?!
Found them.
Huh?
Pigs!
Uh... They're chewing on bones.
Don't tell me...
They're carnivores?
Huh?
What's that?
These pigs are crazy!
The Great Stamp,
the world's most ferocious pig.
They use their large, stout noses
to send their enemies flying.
If you're too slow, you'll end up
as their dinner.
Take that!
What?
Huh?
Just maybe...
Could their foreheads be
their weak points?
So, the pigs evolved large,
strong noses in order to protect
their soft foreheads.
Oh, my. They caught a lot.
This year's applicants are very talented.
However, the difficult part is yet to come.
Now eat the pig and send me
to the next phase.
Okay, it's evaluation time.
Taste testing.
Tastes good!
It's overcooked.
The tough texture ruins the
flavor of the meat.
What? You haven't even tried it!
It's plain as day.
Damn it...
Okay... Dive in!
Huh? Why?
Charred on the outside,
uncooked inside.
Your fire was too strong.
Honestly...
All they're doing is roasting the whole pig,
like it's all they know how to do...
None of them has made any effort!
No one's passed yet...
And Menchi hasn't even taken a bite...
Hey!
Can't anyone out there satisfy me?
That's it!
This phase of the exam is a cooking test,
but they're judging us on originality
and powers of observation.
I see...
How do you like my cooking?
Is this supposed to be a kiddy meal?!
I'm next!
It's basically the same thing!
I am next!
Please judge my creation.
Finally, something that
resembles an actual dish...
The point is to use the provided
facilities and ingredients
to highlight the main feature, the pork.
In other words, the taste is insignificant!
Yuck!
Huh?
Appearance is important,
but only if it also tastes good.
You're no better than #403!
Too bad!
No better than #403...
That was so much food,
I'm stuffed!
Yeah, I'm stuffed, too.
Therefore, no one passes.
We're finished here!
It's over?
What the hell?
As I expected, she's lapsed back
into her old bad habits.
What should we do, Chairman?
I suppose I have no choice.
Fine, I'll have to go in person.
Hunter Vocabulary
Menchi
Zero people passed?
Are you serious?
Does she really mean it?
The exam is over?
This isn't funny!
I won't accept it...
I absolutely refuse to accept this!
In the end, you've still failed.
Stop screwing around!
You asked for pork,
so we risked our lives to—
I said to prepare the pork in a manner
we both found delicious...
None of you made anything
remotely delicious.
You all did almost the same thing.
There was no effort made...
Just when I thought someone actually tried,
they only changed the appearance.
No one attempted to emphasize the flavor.
I'm positive that none of you
took cooking seriously!
Pork dishes are all the same...
Just say that once more.
Any more crap from you,
and I'll shove my arm up your ass
and knock your teeth out!
Don't you mess with me!
There's Menchi's bad habit again...
I don't want any lip from a bunch of
After all, only a handful of chefs
amateurs who can't even roast a pig!
in the entire world can satisfy Menchi.
Hey! What did you just say?
Why don't you repeat it to my face?!
In other words, you people
don't have the guts to try anything new.
Shut up!
I'm not trying to become
a cook or a gourmet...
I want to be a Hunter!
Yeah! Yeah!
My goal is to become a Black List Hunter.
I refuse to let a mere Gourmet Hunter
decide my fate!
Too bad you got stuck with a mere
Gourmet Hunter as an examiner...
Better luck next year?
Why, you...
Don't mock me!
Buhara, don't interfere.
Well...
If I hadn't intervened,
you'd have killed him, right?
Probably.
Let me clarify this...
We frequently venture into the dens
of ferocious beasts,
searching for ingredients.
Every Hunter knows some form
of martial art.
You lack focus and the willingness
to experiment.
That alone disqualifies you
from becoming Hunters!
That said,
it would be excessive to fail
every single applicant.
That's the symbol of the
Hunters Association!
Is it someone from the
Selection Committee?
Wh-Who's that geezer?
The Chairman of the
Selection Committee.
He's in charge of the Hunter Exam...
Chairman Netero.
Well, I work behind the scenes.
I only take action when there's
an issue, like now.
So, Menchi-kun...
Yes, sir.
You failed all of the applicants because
you disapproved of their reluctance
to try new things?
No, sir...
I lost my cool when one
of the candidates
insulted Gourmet Hunters.
And I made the exam harder
than necessary.
In other words, you're aware that
this exam was unacceptable.
Yes, sir.
When cooking is involved,
I lose control.
I'm unqualified to be an examiner.
I will resign as examiner,
so please redo the Second Phase!
But it would be difficult to find
another examiner on such short notice.
I apologize...
Very well. How about this?
I'd like you to continue serving
as an examiner.
But you must also participate
in the new test you propose.
Is that acceptable?
I'm certain that will help
the applicants to accept the results.
That's true...
Then the new challenge will be
boiled eggs!
Boiled eggs?
Chairman, can you take us
to Mt. Split-in-Half
in your airship?
Mt. Split-in-Half?
I see what you're doing.
Certainly, I can.
Now, everyone...
Look down there.
Wh-What is that?
A Spider Eagle's web.
They build webs down there?
Look below the web.
Those are...
Those are Spider Eagle eggs.
Spider Eagles build their webs in deep ravines,
to protect their eggs from predators.
This makes their eggs
one of the most difficult
ingredients to obtain.
The eggs are also known as dream eggs.
W-Wait a minute...
You don't mean we...
I sure do.
What?
Even if she can grab some eggs,
how will she climb back up?
Hey... She jumped down!
Is she trying to kill herself?
No, she's not.
Huh?
That looks fun...
This ravine has updrafts
that help the hatched chicks
fly up to the web.
There. Now I just need to boil the egg.
Y-You must be joking.
No reasonable person would
jump down there...
I've been waiting for this!
Okay! Count me in!
Wait!
I haven't finished explaining everything!
Catch you later.
Let's go!
Not yet.
Why not?
There's no wind.
There isn't always an updraft.
When's the next one?
Wait.
What?
The web won't hold us all!
Gon, not yet?
Damn, I can't wait for an updraft!
It's gonna snap!
Now!
And the rest of you?
I guess you quit.
It takes courage to concede, too.
This is damned good.
Much better than the eggs
you buy in a store...
I can see why they're
called dream eggs.
Hey, Todo-san.
Would you like a bite?
It's delicious...
Now you've experienced the joy
of discovering
how good something can taste.
We're risking our lives for that joy.
I was completely outclassed this year.
I'll be back next year!
The applicants have learned that,
whether you're a Black List Hunter
or a Gourmet Hunter,
calling yourself a Hunter requires an
enormous amount of determination.
Only 42 applicants remain.
Next time: Showdown x On The x Airship!
Use soap when you wash your hands!
R-Right!
﻿Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
The word "unknown" holds magic.
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.
They are known...
...as Hunters!
Now!
Now you've experienced the joy
of discovering
how good something can taste.
We're risking our lives for that joy.
Showdown x On The x Airship
After clearing the exam's Second Phase,
Gon and his friends fly through the starry sky,
toward the site for the Third Phase.
Allow me to introduce myself to the
forty-two remaining applicants.
I am Netero, Chairman of this year's
Hunter Exam Selection Committee.
I am his secretary, Beans.
Originally, I'd planned to
make my appearance
during the exam's final phase,
but as I'm already here...
I'm loving this tension in the air!
So I think I'll stick around for
the rest of the trip.
We are scheduled to arrive
at our destination
tomorrow morning, at 8 AM.
You'll find dinner waiting in the dining hall.
You are also welcome to get some rest.
In other words,
you're free to do as you please
until you are contacted.
Okay, Gon! Let's explore the airship!
Yeah!
How can they have so much energy?
I'm hitting the sack.
You can say that again.
However, I do have one concern...
Hmm? What's up?
How many more phases are there?
Oh...
They've never mentioned that,
have they?
On average, there are five to six phases.
Which means we still have
three or four to go...
All the more reason to rest now.
But you should be careful.
Huh?
The secretary only told us when
we'll arrive at our destination.
It's possible that the third exam could
take place on this airship itself.
And it doesn't necessarily mean we'll
be contacted at 8 AM.
Huh? Are you serious?
Hmm, that does make sense...
You might wake up to discover that
the exam has already ended.
If you plan to make it to the next phase,
don't let yourself relax on this airship.
What the hell...
Well, that was some good advice.
Thanks.
We shall bear that in mind.
Let's all do our best.
Yeah, right...
Here's hoping that you're
both nervous wrecks,
come the morning.
There's no chance that the next phase
will be held on the airship.
Were that their intention,
they wouldn't have said that we were
free to do as we pleased.
They would have told us to stand by.
Hey, how many applicants
do you expect to make it?
You mean pass the exam?
Yep. This year, we have
an impressive group.
Though I did fail them all at one point...
But doesn't it depend
on what the upcoming phases consist of?
That's true...
But didn't you notice it?
One of them had this whole
aura thing going on.
What do you think, Satotz?
Oh, yes.
I like the rookies this year.
Ha! So you agree?
I think #294 has a good shot.
I'm partial to #99.
He looks like a selfish, spoiled brat.
What do you think, Buhara?
Well...
He isn't a rookie,
but #44 is the one I favor.
I'm sure you noticed,
but when #255 was throwing a fit,
it was #44 who was really on the verge
of killing someone.
I did notice that, of course.
He could barely restrain himself
from tearing off our heads.
But didn't you realize?
He was already that way
from the first moment we appeared.
Really?
Yeah, that's the real reason
I was so edgy.
He kept challenging me.
I had a similar experience.
He should be carefully monitored.
Though it pains me to admit this,
we are birds of a feather with him.
However, his affinity
for darkness is far stronger.
As Hunters, we are continually
seeking out rivals.
Ultimately, the Hunter Exam
is but a place to find opponents
worthy of respect.
And every once in a while, we encounter
someone who hits the floor running,
when we try to slow things down.
An oddball of sorts.
Hey, there! Kids!
Stay out of the kitchen!
Go eat in the dining hall!
Wow, awesome!
Look, Gon!
Hmm? What is it?
Whoa!
It's like the ground is covered in jewels!
Yeah!
Hey, I was wondering...
Hmm?
Where are your mom and dad?
Hmm... They're alive.
Probably.
What do they do?
They're assassins.
Huh? Both of them?
That's your first reaction?
You really are a riot!
Huh?
You're the first person who's
ever responded seriously.
Well, you're telling the truth, right?
What makes you think that?
It's just a hunch.
That's weird...
People only like me
because they can't ever tell
whether I'm serious.
I'm from a family of assassins.
So they're all assassins.
And my family has
really high hopes for me...
But I can't stand it.
Who wants to have their life
planned out for them?
When I told them I wanted to
decide my own future,
they all snapped!
My mother had tears
streaming down her face, as she told me
I have the potential to be a top assassin.
Horrible parents, right?
It's natural their kid would go bad.
We ended up fighting.
So I stabbed my mother in the face,
my brother in the side,
and ran away from home.
I'm sure they're out for blood now.
But if they find me,
I'll send them packing.
When I become a Hunter,
I'll start by capturing my family.
I'm sure they're worth some
hefty bounties...
Something wrong?
Ah, Netero-san...
Did you see anyone
coming from that side?
No.
When did he...
You're pretty fast for an old man.
That little trick?
I barely moved.
What do you want?
You don't have to do anything
until the last phase, right?
No need to be so unkind.
I got bored, and was looking
for some companions.
By the way, I meant to ask
the two of you...
Any thoughts on your first attempt
at the Hunter Examination?
Uh-huh! It's fun!
And there haven't been any of the
written exams I was dreading.
I'm disappointed...
I expected the exam to be
far more difficult.
I assume the next phase will
be more entertaining?
Well, now...
I wouldn't know about that.
Let's go, Gon!
Now wait just a moment.
Would you care to play a game with me?
A game?
If you're able to defeat me,
I shall let you be Hunters!
Really? I'll play!
How about it, eh?
Hunter Vocabulary
Netero
Now, I'll go over the rules of the game.
If you can take this ball from me,
before the airship reaches
its destination, you win.
I believe that we're scheduled
for an 8 AM arrival?
Well, that still gives you nine hours.
You're free to attack me
however you'd like.
I won't touch you.
Huh? That's too easy.
You can't call that a game.
Why not give it a try first?
We just have to take the ball?
Yeah.
Then I'll go first.
Go ahead.
He's looking down on me.
I see lots of Killuas!
This is an assassination technique.
Rhythm Echo...
Practitioners use a certain rhythm
to create after-images,
confusing the enemy.
I am astonished that such a young child
has already mastered that technique.
Damn, he keeps darting around.
Is he really an old man?
What? That's it?
In that case,
I'll stop his movement!
Ouch... Right on his pivot leg!
Ow!
He didn't hold back with that kick.
If I were an ordinary person,
that would have shattered my leg.
Damn...
His legs are hard as iron...
Killua!
Tag! Tag!
It's my turn!
What will this kid try?
He appears to be a very honest boy.
Okay!
Oh... He has a quick first step.
But he'd need another ten years
before attacking me head-on.
I guess he is just a child.
Huh? From above?
Ow!
Idiot!
We know that you can jump
really high!
Control your strength!
For a moment, the old man
relaxed his guard!
No kidding...
He may appear simple-minded,
but he clearly uses his head.
I messed up there.
They should keep me entertained
until the morning.
Those two were pretty shaken.
I bet they're too nervous
to get a wink of sleep...
They're sound asleep?
You boys aren't getting anywhere.
Why not attack simultaneously?
Why, you...
Okay... I'll get you this time!
Here they come.
Netero-san hasn't even broken a sweat.
Ow!
So we can't beat him
without subterfuge.
Your attacks are getting boring.
He kicked off his shoe to
increase his range?
A chance!
I think not.
You and your little tricks!
It's mine!
I commend you on your efforts.
You're amazing, Netero-san!
Really amazing!
Forget it...
I give up.
I lose!
Huh?
Oh? He's quitting?
Why? We still have time.
And just now, we came really close.
Jeez. You really have no clue, do you?
The old man has barely used his
right hand and his left leg.
What?
But we're still powerless against him.
We could chase him around for a year,
and never take the ball from him.
Oh, you figured it out?
And here, I thought I'd fooled you.
So that's what he was doing.
You really know how to
piss me off, old man.
Let's go, Gon!
Oh, I'm gonna play a little longer.
Huh?
Didn't you hear what I said?!
It's useless!
You won't be able to take
the ball from him!
Yeah! I don't care about the ball.
We've only used up half
of the time limit.
I'm gonna make Netero-san
use his right hand
before the time runs out.
I see...
Yeah, I got it.
Good luck.
I'm getting some sleep.
Say, Netero-san...
Hmm?
How did Killua do that thing
where he walked slowly,
and it looked like there were
a bunch of Killuas?
That technique is for those engaged
in underground work.
You have no need to learn it.
In fact, you should not learn it.
But it's an amazing technique, right?
It requires an intensive amount
of training.
Killua's really something!
You fool.
Damn it! Now I'm in a bad mood.
Well, I guess there's
nothing for it.
Hey.
Wait up, kid.
You bump into us,
and then ignore us?
Bastard!
If I hadn't stopped then,
I'd have ended up killing that
old man to get the ball.
Oh, he's moving faster.
Here it comes!
He'll feint for the ball,
but attack my stomach!
O-Ouch!
One more!
If he head-butts me in the stomach again,
he'll shatter his skull.
But if I relax my stomach,
I'll be the one suffering.
I'll run away.
Ah, is he dead?
You just used your right hand!
I did it!
Hooray...
Hello, helmsman?
It's me. Is the flight going well?
I see.
I'm sorry to ruin it for you,
but could you fly a little slower?
During a game Netero proposed to kill time,
he's seen something in Gon.
The airship and its 42 applicants
approach the site of the exam's Third Phase.
Next time: Decision x By x Majority?
Majority, majority...
Authority!
Minority?
﻿Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
The word "unknown" holds magic.
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.
They are known...
...as Hunters!
One more!
You just used your right hand!
I did it!
Hooray...
Decision x By x Majority?
Dawn breaks,
as the airship carrying Gon and his friends
approaches its destination.
The Third Phase of the Hunter Exam
is about to begin.
I apologize for the long wait.
The airship will soon arrive
at its destination.
Wow!
Is that where the next test will be held?
What is this place?
There's nothing here.
Ahem...
Everyone, the exam's Third Phase
will begin here,
at the top of Trick Tower.
Trick Tower?
To pass this phase,
you must reach the tower's base alive.
The time limit is seventy-two hours.
With that, we will now begin
the Third Phase.
I will pray for your success.
No way.
So it's finally my turn?
Best of luck to everyone!
Are we supposed to climb down?
That would be suicide...
Maybe for a normal person.
But a top-class rock climber can
handle this, no problem.
Wow...
He's going down pretty fast.
Looks like I'll be the first one
to pass the Third Phase...
Stop! Stay away!
Stop! Stop it!
Help!
G-Guess we can't climb down the side...
Yeah.
What's up?
There are fewer people around.
What?
I count twenty-three,
which suggests almost half of the
applicants have already found an exit.
No way. When did they do that?
That means there must be
some hidden doors that lead below.
Kurapika! Leorio!
What is it, Gon?
Look. I found a hidden door.
I see now.
So we can descend by flipping the stones.
Okay!
Great job, Gon!
Let's head on down!
But I'm confused.
About what?
There are also hidden doors here,
there, over there,
and over there, as well.
That many?
Five hidden doors,
located in the same area.
It sounds suspicious to me.
Some could be traps.
And it looks as though
each door can only be used once...
Seriously?
We tried opening a door
someone else used,
but it wouldn't budge.
Judging by the door's size,
only one can fit at a time.
In other words, only one person
can use each door.
We'll have to split up.
Gon and I decided that we're each
going to choose a door.
No hard feelings if one
of us springs a trap!
What are you guys gonna do?
I can live with that.
Luck is part of the game...
I have no objection.
Then that settles it.
Let's go, on the count of three.
I guess this is goodbye for now.
We'll meet up again, at the tower's base.
Let's go...
One!
Two!
Three!
Huh?
Huh? What?
That was quite a brief farewell.
Oh,
so all the doors led to the same room...
"The five of you
must follow the will of the majority
to reach the goal."
Five of us?
Look... There are five stopwatches.
There's an O and an X button.
Could it be that we won't be
able to leave this room
until another person drops in?
That is correct!
Who's that?!
My name is Lippo.
I am the prison warden here,
as well as the Third Phase examiner.
Prison warden?
Multiple routes through this tower
have been prepared.
You have chosen the path
of majority rule.
Cooperation will be key
if you wish to clear this
phase of the exam.
One person's selfish behavior
can derail an entire group.
And you can't start until you
have five members.
Best of luck, gentlemen!
We can't move on until
someone else arrives?
What do we do?
We have to wait, I guess...
Did you need something, warden?
The test begins now.
Take your assigned positions.
Okay.
Oh, come on!
It's been two hours...
What if the others all took
different routes?
Only a fool would still be at
the top of the tower!
Calm down, Leorio.
Complaining won't help.
But...
What if no one shows up before
we reach our time limit?
Hey!
I can't just sit here and...
Quiet!
Huh?
That sound...
Good grief...
Tonpa-san.
Oh.
It's the old man.
Okay!
I see.
So the door appears
once five people arrive and
put on the stopwatches.
"At this door, select
O to open, X not to open."
Forcing us to use majority rule already?
The answer should be obvious...
What?
Who pushed the X button?
Sorry, that was me.
I pressed the wrong button
by mistake.
Stop screwing around, old man!
Are you blind?
Like I said, it was an accident.
How can you accidentally press
the wrong button?!
It doesn't matter.
The door opened.
No, it does matter!
This guy deliberately pressed
the wrong button...
Let's go.
We don't have time to bicker.
That's right...
Even if he keeps pressing
the wrong one,
the rest of us just need to
press the right one.
Fine.
Okay, let's go!
Damn...
Seriously...
Another question so soon?
"Which way do you want to go?
O for right. X for left."
Right...
Or left...
Huh?!
Wh-Why would you choose to go right?
Normally, you should go left...
That is true.
Studies have indicated that people
who are lost or stuck at forks
unconsciously tend to go left.
I've heard that before, too.
Wait! The numbers don't add up!
Which button did you press?
Right.
Right.
Y-You guys...
That's why they chose to go right...
To outfox the examiner.
If the examiner knows that
people tend to go left,
the left path will be more difficult.
So we're just simple-minded!
We?
Wh-What is this place?
Look over there.
The applicants have arrived.
Remove the shackles.
Jeez...
I'm finally free.
Hunter Vocabulary
Tonpa
Allow me to explain, gentlemen.
Before you are some of
Trick Tower's prisoners.
Prisoners?
The Hunter Exam Committee
has also officially hired them
as examiners.
You will be fighting against
the five of them.
The fights will be one-on-one.
Each person may only fight once.
You are free to use any method you like.
There will be no draws.
A win is declared when the
opponent admits defeat.
You may pick your order.
It's majority rule.
So secure three wins, and you may pass.
The rules are simple.
Tsk...
Majority rule again?
Well, I prefer straightforward rules.
However, the actual fights will
not be quite so simple.
The prisoners' sentences will be reduced
by one year, for every hour they
delay the applicants here.
In other words, their goal
is also to buy time.
I understand...
And we must reach the goal
within seventy-two hours.
So time will be critical during these fights.
Okay, I'm up first.
Bendot
199-year sentence, robbery and murder
Choose your combatant!
What should we do?
He said that we can fight
with any method.
So that means anything goes.
We don't know what they'll try to pull...
There's too much at stake without knowing
what they have up their sleeves.
Given that, I shall...
No, I'll go!
Tonpa-san?
I'll act as a guinea pig,
so we can discover what they're up to.
Consider this an apology for before.
Hey, are you serious?
Sure.
Plus, you guys don't actually
trust me, right?
Do you really want me to be the tiebreaker,
when the score is 2-2?
You have a point...
Then it's settled.
Tonpa, you're...
Th-That was a surprise...
I didn't expect Tonpa to volunteer.
He called himself a guinea pig.
Will Tonpa-san be okay?
Now, let us determine the
method of combat.
I propose a death match.
A death match?
They fight until one dies?
No...
Don't let him provoke you!
Well?
Very well...
I accept!
Huh?
Seriously?
I commend you for your courage!
T-Tonpa...
Let the fight begin!
I...
I give!
Huh?
What?
Did he just give up?
M-Maybe he meant "Give me a sec"?
What did you just say?
You win if I admit defeat, right?
I give up...
I lose!
Wha... Wha... Wha...
All right...
I win this round.
If we win two more rounds, you lose.
You won't be able to advance or turn back.
You'll be stuck here until the
seventy-two hours are up.
Should that come to pass,
our sentences will be reduced
by seventy-two years.
Man, that was a disgrace.
He looked a lot stronger up close...
Bastard...
You just confirmed all my suspicions!
You're a worthless piece of trash,
who's only good for sabotaging
other applicants!
Exactly.
That's what I do every year.
And I plan to continue the tradition.
Wh-What?
I'm not looking to pass the Hunter Exam.
I'm only in it for the thrills.
The thrills?
Yes.
The Hunter Exam is a trial meant
to crush confident young people's dreams.
The moment of despair,
when ambition and hope give way,
gives me a sense of exquisite pleasure.
Especially when I'm actively
shattering these rookies' dreams.
I don't plan on becoming a Hunter.
I've already had enough fun this year.
It's time for me to bow out.
You bastard...
Stop, Leorio!
But...
They want us to waste our time,
fighting amongst ourselves.
However,
if their goal is to buy time,
then the old man made
the correct choice.
Huh?
That bald guy is probably
a former soldier or mercenary.
Had you fought him,
he would have started by
crushing your throat,
so you couldn't have given up.
Then he would have tortured you,
without killing you,
for the rest of the remaining time...
Th-That was one of the possibilities
I took into consideration...
You look sick.
My plan was disrupted.
I was going to take my time,
punishing him...
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.
Sedokan
149-year sentence, serial bombings
If we defeat two of the remaining four,
then we win.
Regardless, we need to win
three rounds and advance.
Who's going next?
Me! I'll go!
Are you sure?
Uh-huh!
The next opponent doesn't
look too strong.
But you can't let your guard down.
He's still a criminal.
Uh-huh, I know.
Tonpa's actions
have placed Gon and his friends
at a disadvantage.
What is their next opponent,
Sedokan, planning to do in this match?
At the start of the Hunter Exam's Third Phase,
there were 40 applicants.
With 1 eliminated,
only 39 remain.
Next time: Beware x Of x Prisoners.
And watch your back!
Be careful when you're out late.
﻿Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
The word "unknown" holds magic.
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.
They are known...
...as Hunters!
I...
I give!
Huh?
What?
Bastard...
You just confirmed all my suspicions!
You're a worthless piece of trash,
who's only good for sabotaging
other applicants!
Exactly.
That's what I do every year.
And I plan to continue the tradition.
I'm not looking to pass the Hunter Exam.
Beware x Of x Prisoners
The Third Phase of the exam is
taking place at Trick Tower,
a prison for long-term prisoners.
Gon and his friends have chosen to partake
in a five-on-five battle with
some of the prisoners.
Due to Tonpa's actions,
they've already suffered one loss.
The next round
will pit Gon against Sedokan.
What will happen in the upcoming battle?
Now, then...
Sedokan
149-year sentence, serial bombings
As you can see, I'm not very strong.
I don't really enjoy fistfights
or other physical activities,
such as running and jumping.
I do.
But I'm not too good at using my head.
As I thought.
So I came up with a simple game
we could both play.
A game?
Yes.
It doesn't rely on either mental
or physical activity.
What kind of game?
We each light a candle at the same time.
The one whose candle goes
out first is the loser.
What do you think?
Yeah! That's easy to understand.
Let's go with that.
Okay. In that case...
...decide which candle you want to use.
Press O for the long one,
or X for the short one.
This will be determined
by majority rule.
We have to choose one?
This is a trap!
Normally, you'd choose the long one,
so he must have done something
to the long one!
That would be the safe assumption.
But it might be a trick,
and he's actually tampered
with the short one.
When you put it like that...
Yes, there is no end...
You've got a real dilemma there.
You keep your mouth shut!
Yeah, yeah.
When presented with a
clearly uneven choice,
people become suspicious and
hesitate before deciding.
Yes, this is a real dilemma.
What's worse, if you make the wrong choice,
the resulting mental anguish
would be much greater than if the problem
had offered two fair options.
Take your time.
This may be a majority decision,
but you're free to discuss it.
We have plenty of time.
Hmm...
Hey, which one should I choose?
Damn...
Which one should we take?
Gon, you decide!
We'll abide by your decision.
Choose the one you think is best.
Are you sure about this?
He never thinks anything through.
Instead of wasting time fretting
over what to do,
let's rely on Gon's instincts.
Instincts, huh...
I get to choose?
Okay!
Then I choose the long one!
You want the long candle?
Because a longer candle
will burn a longer time!
Er, he's just taking it at face value?
I knew he wouldn't think this through.
Well, that's that.
It's not like we can figure out
which one is the trap.
Okay.
You get the long one.
I'll take the short one.
Now, we light our candles together.
Normally,
how long would it take that
candle to burn down?
Five to six hours?
Whoa... That was close.
A strong wind is coming from below.
That means we should watch our step...
No time to relax, huh...
If you don't pay attention,
your candle will go out.
That's because you're planning
to do something bad.
Otherwise, your candle would go out first.
I won't do anything.
After all...
I've already taken steps.
See?
Hey! Look at Gon's candle!
The flame suddenly became stronger!
He must have hidden gunpowder or some other
highly flammable substance inside,
to make the candle burn faster!
H-Hot...
At this rate, his candle will only last
another two or three minutes.
Damn!
Hey! That was dirty!
I knew you tampered with
the long candle!
Heh, you're wrong.
I had four candles prepared.
The dilemma you faced was mere
camouflage for the actual trap.
You were given the impression that only
one candle had been interfered with.
The choices were so uneven,
you didn't consider
the possibility that both had been.
It didn't matter which candle you picked.
Either way, I would have handed you
an oil-soaked candle.
If the fire is stronger,
then a little breeze won't extinguish it.
He's fast!
I win!
Yes!
Oh, he has a real spring to his step.
And the ability to take advantage
of a bad situation.
I'm impressed by this boy.
Yay! I won!
Good job, Gon!
Now we have a win!
Once Kurapika and I win,
we can advance!
Hmph, you fool.
That's the result of reliance on
tools and cheap tricks.
Tsk.
If you want to fool someone,
you have to sacrifice a bit.
Just watch.
All right.
I'll go next.

108-year sentence, multiple crimes, including fraud and blackmail
That's one freaky body...
And face...
Look here!
I've killed nineteen people,
but it bugs me that nineteen is
such an uneven number.
I'm so glad I've gotten to
meet number twenty.
Now we have a serial killer?
I insist that we put our lives on the line.
I won't accept some half-assed contest.
Blood!
Entrails!
Agony!
Well?
You must be scared now...
Very well.
Huh?
You can decide how we
settle this contest.
I'll agree to your choice.
O-Oh...
You've got balls.
Hmph...
I know you're quaking in your boots.
How long can you maintain
the tough guy act?
In that case, I also propose
a death match, where we fight until
one of us surrenders or dies.
However, don't expect me to stop
when you surrender and
beg for your life!
Well?
Surely you're scared stiff now?
Very well. I accept.
Huh?
Let us begin.
Is he an idiot?
Didn't he hear what I said?
We're fighting to the death!
Wait, he should have been scared
once he saw me!
Hold on.
I forgot to mention something.
No weapons allowed.
We'll beat each other to death
with our fists.
After all, while I may be hired as
an examiner, I'm still a prisoner.
I'm not allowed to carry weapons.
I see.
I understand.
Anything else?
If not, I'd like to get started.
Huh?
That little bastard...
He had a concealed weapon!
That was close.
However, it appears that
he doesn't rely on it.
He's that confident in his fighting ability?
No, that doesn't seem to be the case.
Hmph, maybe he wants to run,
but he can't in front of his friends.
Or he's so stupid, he can't even imagine
how scary I am?
Yes! That must be it...
Well, in that case,
I have a couple of cards up my sleeve
for dealing with such fools.
Hey, now.
Is Kurapika gonna be okay?
This guy looks dangerous.
In what way does he look dangerous?
As far as I can tell,
this guy's just a blowhard who
doesn't have the guts
to hit anyone, let alone kill anyone.
You don't need to worry.
Huh?
Why not?
Because when I look at him,
I don't get chills.
What does that mean?
Time to show you the ace up my sleeve!
I'll see you dead!
Here he comes!
Wow...
He made a hole in the floor
with his bare fist!
That was perfect...
And I still have one more trick.
A tattoo of a spider with twelve legs...
That's...
Yeah, I recognize it.
Anyone aspiring to become
a Hunter has heard of it.
That's the symbol worn by members of
that notorious band of evil thieves,
the Phantom Troupe!
Really?
Yeah, definitely.
They're famous.
I heard about them
straight from Kurapika.
Between the steel implanted in my body
that gives my arms
the strength to shatter rock,
and the Phantom Troupe symbol...
After seeing both,
no one would want to fight me!
What's wrong?
Cat got your tongue?
I'm Majitani, one of the
Phantom Troupe's four kings!
Consider that first strike
my way of saying hello.
This is your last chance to surrender.
I'm still willing to...
Huh?
Wh-What's wrong with you?
Huh?
Wh-What?
O-O-Okay...
Wait! I get it!
I surrender!
Consider this a warning...
First,
a real Phantom Troupe tattoo has the
member's number on the spider.
Second,
they don't bother counting
how many they've killed.
Third,
never mention the Troupe again.
If you do,
I'll kill you.
Wow...
Kurapika...
Well, saw that coming
from a mile away.
Yup...
You okay, Kurapika?
Yeah, I'm not injured.
Also,
is it safe for us to be near you?
From the moment I saw him,
I knew he was weak.
And mentally, I knew that
tattoo was a fake.
But as soon as I saw that spider,
everything in my sight turned red...
Well, I can't really blame you.
Actually, to tell the truth...
Hmm?
Even when I see a real spider,
my personality changes,
and I enter a frenzy.
You should have told us sooner...
But this means that
the rage in me remains
as strong as ever.
I suppose I should be happy.
We should keep Kurapika
away from spiders.
Definitely.
Damn you, Majitani...
You were completely worthless.
His facial scars were from a botched
plastic surgery operation.
That's one hell of a fraud.
Hey, you understand, right?
After two losses, our backs
are against the wall.
Let me handle it.
I have a good idea.
Okay! I'll secure our victory!
Kurapika has defeated Majitani.
Another win, and they
will clear this trial.
How will Leorio handle
the next challenge?
Next time: Trick x To The x Trick!
The trick to the trick is to trick...
I can't say it.
Don't just give up.
﻿Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
The word "unknown" holds magic.
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.
They are known...
...as Hunters!
Consider this a warning...
First,
a real Phantom Troupe tattoo has the
member's number on the spider.
Second,
they don't bother counting
how many they've killed.
Third,
never mention the Troupe again.
If you do,
I'll kill you.
Trick x To The x Trick
Leorio has volunteered for
the fourth round.
If he wins, the group's victory is assured.
But can he win?
Okay!
I'll finish up the job.
Toss that guy out, and send in
your next competitor!
We can't do that.
What's that?
We can't move him yet,
because his match hasn't been settled.
The match hasn't been settled?
What do you mean?
He's still alive.
He was only knocked out.
Did you forget?
This was a death match.
The fight doesn't end until one
contestant surrenders or dies.
He's still alive, and he
hasn't surrendered.
Tsk... Damned technicalities!
But she's right.
I agree.
I see...
Hey, Kurapika!
Go finish off that worthless trash.
I refuse.
Huh?
Why?!
The fight is over.
He'd already lost his will to fight
when I punched him.
I will not fight someone who's lost.
Screw that!
Then what do we do?
They're claiming that the
match hasn't ended!
Let him handle it.
Huh?!
Once he wakes up,
we'll have our answer.
Hey, now...
We only have so much time left.
We can't afford to just sit and wait!
I have no intention of killing him!
Come on!
Hey...
If you don't want to dirty
your hands, I'll do it.
Killua?
You haven't ever killed
anyone before, right?
Are you scared?
I have never considered whether
murder is frightening.
But this is a one-on-one battle.
You aren't permitted to interfere.
Okay, then...
But we're working as a team,
so you shouldn't be too selfish.
Oh!
You do say useful things sometimes!
Keep it up!
Don't you understand that you're
screwing up our chances?
I'm sorry, but I won't change my mind.
You stubborn fool...
Fine!
A majority decision...
O to kill him,
and X to leave him alive.
Ready, and...
Why isn't it working?!
Maybe it's because we're
asking the question?
Huh?
The watches only work for questions
presented by the examiners.
I see...
Okay!
Then we'll use a show of hands!
Those who agree that he
should be finished off...
Now!
You traitor...
Weren't you just lecturing
Kurapika with me?
We're supposed to be a team...
A team!
But it's pointless!
He's not gonna change his mind.
Hey, Gon!
Why do you oppose killing him?
Kurapika's right.
He was on the verge of surrendering.
Let's wait for him to wake up.
We don't know how long
that will take.
I should just...
You shouldn't force others to do things.
Different people have different
circumstances and ideals.
No one asked your opinion.
Hey...
A majority ruling implies that you're
asking everyone's opinion.
Damn it! Fine!
Do whatever you want!
Leorio...
Man, what's wrong with these people?
Now he's sulking.
None of this matters if we can't even progress.
Don't you people get it?
Just leave him alone.
Fools...
They've fallen for the trap
of the majority decision.
You would expect it to be easier
for five people who've just met
to make decisions by majority rule.
While this method appears to
revere each individual opinion,
in actuality, it suppresses the minority.
When a person consistently finds himself
in the minority,
his opinion is always rejected.
His alienation,
anger, and discontent lead to antagonism.
Eventually, the team dissolves.
After all, we're rivals in
this Hunter Exam.
None of us would just
stand by and watch,
as our chances were hurt
by someone else's dumb mistakes.
But having been caught up in
the spirit of this test,
he's begun using majority decision
in unrelated situations.
And he made the mistake of holding
a discussion before the vote.
He even used majority decision in its
worst form, a public show of hands.
Unlike when people press the buttons
of their own watches,
everyone knows who diverged
from the majority.
So the minority can't even
protest the decision.
When someone feels they have no say,
and that their opinions are
constantly rejected,
the group breaks down.
In this case,
it means all five of us will fail the exam.
It's just a matter of time.
The atmosphere on the
other side is gloomy.
I've been waiting for you...
...Hisoka.
I'm not an examiner this year.
I'm here for revenge.
Since last year's exam,
all I've focused on was killing you.
Today, I'll get payback
for my scars!
Hmph.
Those scars merely show that you
were an incompetent examiner.
You're blaming me for your
own inadequacies.
Keep yapping!
Prepare to die.
Dual wielding?
Infinite quad wielding!
Take this...
It's not over yet!
Up, down, left, right.
Front and back...
You have nowhere to run!
You'll be cut from every angle,
by my endless stream of blades.
Dodging my infinite attack waves
is impossible!
I'll have you writhe in pain...
...until you die, Hisoka!
It would indeed be difficult
to dodge your attacks.
Thus, I should simply stop the blades.
Impossible...
It took me over half a year
to master catching those blades!
Oh...
It was easier than anticipated.
I appreciate your futile efforts.
Damn it!

Hisoka
Hisoka, applicant #44, is the first
to pass the Third Phase.
Total time, six hours and
seventeen minutes.
Tsk...
Is something wrong, Gon?
Uh-huh.
I get it...
Hey...
It's quite possible that
he's already dead.
What's that?
Well, it's been several hours,
and he hasn't moved an inch.
Damn...
It's too far away for us to tell.
Hey! We want to check his body!
What's that?
He could already be dead.
I already told you,
he's only unconscious.
How many hours has it been?
I can't just take your word for it!
Then let's make a bet.
A bet?
On what?
On whether he's dead or alive.
What would we wager?
Time.
Time?
We will settle our match through
a betting game, a gamble.
And we'll use time, rather than chips.
Look at the monitor on the wall.
We each have fifty hours.
However, we can only wager
multiples of ten.
We continue placing bets until one
of us has no hours left.
A match where we gamble time...
We'll take turns deciding
what to bet on.
If you end up with zero hours,
your time limit will also be
shortened by fifty hours.
And if you end up with zero hours?
Our sentences will be
extended by fifty years.
If these terms are acceptable,
I'll check whether he's still alive.
Leroute...
Serving a 112-year sentence
for endangered species trafficking
and illegal gambling.
This match sounds like
her kind of game.
Man, this chick is whack.
She's willing to risk extending
her own sentence.
Consider your answer carefully, Leorio.
If you lose, we'll have
fifty fewer hours
with which to escape the tower.
You shouldn't talk...
After all, this is your fault,
for not finishing him off!
Fine!
I won't say another word!
Hey, we shouldn't fight
amongst ourselves!
Keep fighting, keep fighting...
Right!
I accept!
Okay! I chose our first bet,
so you can decide how
many hours we'll wager
on whether he's alive or dead.
I bet ten hours that he's alive.
What's this?
You were the one whining
over his being dead.
Very well. Then let's check.
You're being pretty cautious...
Weren't you going to not
say anything else?
Ten hours, huh?
This was the obvious choice.
Even if I'm wrong,
as long as we confirm his death,
Kurapika will have won his round.
If he's really unconscious,
I'll just kick his ass.
See? He's only unconscious.
So it seems.
All right...
Leorio has the lead!
This is bad.
Huh?
It's possible he isn't going to wake up.
What do you mean?
Remember when that woman
walked near the guy on the floor?
What of it?
I thought then
that he was already dead.
But on second thought,
they'd obviously prefer him alive,
but remaining unconscious.
If he doesn't wake up
before the test ends,
it shortens their sentences
by seventy-two years.
So if he doesn't wake up...
That's my point!
That's been their intention all along.
Well, it's your turn.
Decide what we'll bet on.
Let's see...
How about we bet on whether
he's truly unconscious?
Huh?
I see.
Hey, what am I supposed to do?
The note didn't cover this.
When I woke up, a note next to me
told me to feign unconsciousness,
and to hide the note in my mouth.
I understood the plan immediately.
If I can buy time by pretending
to be asleep,
our sentences will be shortened
by seventy-two years!
So, then what do I do?
Should I stay down?
Very well.
I bet twenty hours that he
really is unconscious.
Okay, got it...
I'm supposed to keep acting
like I'm unconscious!
But how do we confirm whether
he's really unconscious?
Oh...
That's simple.
This guy's heavy...
I'll just toss him off the edge.
Wh-What the hell?!
If he's actually unconscious,
he'll fall to his death.
Are you insane?
His match hasn't been settled yet.
We can't accept those terms.
Don't worry.
If he falls and dies,
we'll forfeit the match,
which will give you two wins.
Is that satisfactory?
Yes,
it is.
What was that?
Don't be ridiculous...
We're talking about my life here!
But then I'm changing my wager.
I bet forty hours that he
isn't unconscious.
Everything I have left.
Heh, little sneak.
Finally showing your true colors.
Then, I'll let go of him.
Whoa! Wait!
I'm awake! I'm awake...
Don't let go!
Wait! Whoa...
I'm gonna fall!
Good morning.
You people are crazy.
I've had enough!
I'll take the loss!
Forget the sentence reduction!
It's safer in prison...
You knew that he was awake.
I actually aspire to become a doctor.
All I had to do was check
his eye movement.
However, you're down
to twenty hours.
But now we have a 2-1 lead.
Now...
It's your turn!
What do you want to bet on?
Majitani surrenders,
giving Gon and his friends a 2-1 lead.
However, in the time-betting match,
they're down 80-20.
What will Leroute choose to bet on?
Next time: Trouble x With The x Gamble!
Bulldog... Bulldog...
Bulldog scramble!
﻿Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
The word "unknown" holds magic.
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.
They are known...
...as Hunters!
Then, I'll let go of him.
Whoa! Wait!
I'm awake! I'm awake...
Don't let me go!
However, you're down to twenty hours.
But now we have a 2-1 lead.
Now...
It's your turn!
What do you want to bet on?
Trouble x With The x Gamble
In the five-on-five battle
with the prisoners,
Gon and his friends lead 2-1.
They're one win away from victory.
The fourth round is a series of wagers,
with time as the stakes.
What will they bet on next?
Well, are you going to tell me
what the next bet will be?
Or have you lost your nerve because
I've figured out your scheme?
Very well.
Leroute
112-year sentence, illegal gambling
and endangered species trafficking
H-Huh?
She's really cute...
That old guy's probably
dancing on the inside.
I have a bad feeling about this.
Then let's bet on whether
I'm a man or a woman.
Huh?
What's wrong?
Is there a problem?
N-No.
She's obviously a woman...
Or could she be a tranny?
No, she's gotta be a woman.
That's fine,
but how will you prove if I'm wrong?
Oh, right...
I'll let you examine every part of my body.
Until you're fully satisfied.
Seriously?
Her body?
Leorio will bet she's a man.
Uh-huh.
Huh? Why?
Okay, I've decided.
I bet ten hours that you're a man!
I knew it.
Dirty old man...
Huh? But how did you know?
This way, even if I'm wrong,
and it turns out she's female,
I'll still get to examine her body!
It's a win-win situation.
Actually, please be wrong...
There you have it.
I get it now.
Okay! Reveal the answer!
Too bad... I'm a woman.
R-Really?
Would you like to check?
B-B-But of course!
A mistake I do not regret.
Just watching hurts...
He's gonna lose.
Huh?
The opponent has seen through
Leorio's strategy.
He's been betting conservatively,
to minimize damage from either outcome.
A gambler who focuses on avoiding
a loss won't ever win.
I guess Leorio just doesn't
have what it takes.
As expected.
His approach to gambling
doesn't frighten me at all.
He'll never beat me that way.
Now it's your turn to think of a gamble.
What do you want to bet on?
This is no time to celebrate.
I only have ten hours left...
Leorio has no more room for error.
If he loses the next wager,
the overall score will be 2-2.
And we will have fifty fewer hours
to escape this tower.
Leorio...
I can't lose the next bet,
but I can't think of anything
that'd be a surefire win...
Oh, that's it!
We can bet on whether I'm
a man or a woman.
No, that wouldn't work...
Hey, old man...
You're thinking aloud.
I know.
Leorio!
Huh?
How about whether or not
you're still in your teens?
Come on, Gon!
I don't look that old...
I'm clearly a teenager!
T-Teenager?
But he looks like an old man.
Right! In that case, we'll use
rock-paper-scissors!
A bet on who'll win a game
of rock-paper-scissors!
Sure.
Rock-paper-scissors?
Why did he have to pick
such a difficult wager?
Huh?
Rock-paper-scissors is hard?
I happen to be quite confident in
my rock-paper-scissors skill.
Just recently, I won a gourmet vacation
in a tournament in the shopping district.
Let's see, then.
I'll put eighty hours on my victory.
E-Eighty hours?
Is something wrong?
I'm free to bet as much as I want.
W-Well, that's true.
And if you lose, I can still only
take ten from you.
Don't worry.
She doesn't need to bet eighty.
Ten would suffice.
What if she loses?
Or is she that confident?
As anticipated, he's starting to stress.
He's so easy to read.
While rock-paper-scissors has simple rules,
the game itself is quite complex.
If you consider the game
from a probability standpoint,
there's only a one-third chance of losing.
However, if your opponent can predict
your reasoning and control your reactions,
defeat becomes much more likely.
In other words, simple-minded Leorio
will be at a disadvantage.
I see.
All right! I've made my decision.
What?
It's obvious what you'll use.
I can read minds.
Liar!
Your bluffing won't scare me!
You'll believe me soon enough.
As planned, he's losing his
cool over a blatant lie.
She can read minds?
She's lying. She must be lying...
But what if she's telling the truth?
Leorio will use rock.
Huh?
Let's do this!
Rock...
Paper...
Scissors!
You were right.
Good guess.
Nervous people unconsciously avoid
any action that involves opening up.
In other words, by making
Leorio uncomfortable, she ensures
that he's less likely to use paper.
So if she sticks with rock,
she's guaranteed a win or draw.
As I was explaining, rock-paper-scissors
is actually a mind game.
Now I see.
Hold on.
Since we both used rock, wasn't that a draw?
What of it?
A-ha!
So you were lying about being
able to read my mind!
If you really could, you'd have won.
Right?
What's so funny?
I deliberately gave you that tie.
Quit lying!
Did you forget?
We're trying to stall you here.
If I chose to, I could force an
indefinite series of draws...
But that wouldn't be any fun.
So I'll end this with the next turn.
Well? What will you use next?
Think hard.
Come on.
Damn!
That's it.
Worry. Fret.
Worrying. Fretting.
When someone loses confidence,
they crave reassurance.
That makes him more likely to
either use the same hand,
or, in an effort to regain his confidence,
to use a stronger one than
in the previous round.
Meaning
that she wants Leorio to choose
either rock or paper.
Yes.
If she uses paper, she's certain not to lose.
Then Leorio just needs to stay a step ahead!
Well, if he could calm down,
that might work.
Leorio!
What is it?
Hey, you'll win if you go with scissors next!
What? Scissors?
Go ahead and try.
Then she'll just use rock.
No, she'll go a step further
and choose paper.
Wait, then she'll take another
step and use scissors...
No, no, then she'll take
another step and use rock...
Man, I have no idea what to think!
Here we go!
Here...
comes the...
draw!
I win!
Rock-paper-scissors really is complicated.
Now the score is 2-2.
Worse yet, we have to give up
the fifty hours he lost.
Sorry. I was pretty confident in my
rock-paper-scissors ability.
Pretty pathetic showing, then.
What was that?!
Well, I can't argue with you on this one.
Say, how much time do
they have left now?
Fifty-nine hours, forty-five minutes.
Which means
they actually have fewer
than ten hours left.
It doesn't matter how much time they have.
Because my opponent will die.
Hunter Vocabulary
Rock-Paper-Scissors
It's finally time for the last round.
Guess I'm off.
What? Killua?
What's that supposed to mean?
Damn it! I really needed
to win my round...
Gon... This guy is totally pissing me off!
Now, now.
Don't give up before we even know
what the contest is.
Well, if it's something like
mental math, I'm surrendering.
That's right!
Depending on the opponent,
we still have a chance!
That little kid is their last member.
Never thought I'd see him
fall prey to that monster.
Poor thing. He's still so young.
I didn't want to use him.
However, the Hunter Exam has no mercy.
If he dies here, that's fate.
I'm removing his handcuffs.
You guys are getting too scared...
Idiot, stop!
Is he really that terrifying?
Isn't it all just ancient history?
That guy...
You know him?
We should take the loss.
Killua!
Don't fight him.
Why not?
Johness the Dissector.
Johness
968-year sentence, mass murder
The worst mass murderer in Zaban's history.
He chose his victims randomly.
It was a famous case...
146 people, young and old, men and women,
met with brutal deaths by his hand.
The victims had one thing in common.
He murdered all of them
with his bare hands.
He was known for his iron grip,
the power in his fingers.
It's been so long since
I touched human flesh.
You don't have to face that psychotic killer...
There's always next year.
Hey, Killua...
Killua!
Damn it, was he even listening to me?!
We should let him go.
He could have a plan.
How are we settling this contest?
Contest?
I believe you're confused.
This will be a one-sided massacre.
I have no interest in the exam
or any offer of amnesty.
I just want to hear you scream.
Really? Okay.
Then the loser is the one who dies.
Yeah, that's right.
I'll tear your body apart.
Wh-What?
I'm so cold.
That's...
mine.
G-Give it back.
Okay. That's three wins, two losses.
We pass, right?
Yeah, you win.
By the way, you must be
itching for some action,
since you didn't get to do anything.
Want to play with me?
I'll abstain.
Oh, okay.
Who is he?
That's right. You guys don't know.
Huh? Don't know what?
Killua comes from an elite family of assassins.
Eh? A-An elite family of assassins?
I'm back.
What?
Uh... Well,
good work!
Across the bridge,
you'll find a small room.
You must spend the fifty hours
you gambled away there.
Well, let's go.
Yeah!
R-Right...
Gittarackur, applicant #301,
is the second to pass.
Total time, twelve hours
and two minutes.
I figured you'd already
crossed the finish line.
All right!
Hanzo, applicant #294, is the third to pass.
I'm the first to finish!
Huh?
Total time, twelve hours
and three minutes.
No!
I don't believe this...
I came in third.
Good grief.
We have to spend fifty hours
in this room?
Killua.
Huh?
Can you tell me how that
technique works?
Technique?
The one you used to instantly
remove his heart.
Oh, that wasn't even a technique.
I just ripped it out.
Ripped it out?
But to make it easier,
I manipulated my body a bit.
Y-Your nails...
Wow!
Mass murderers are still only amateurs.
I used to be a professional.
But my old man would've done better.
When he removes a heart, you won't
see even a drop of blood.
How reassuring.
As long as he's on our side...
Well, then.
We have more than two whole days.
What should we do, Killua?
First, we should search the room
for any kind of entertainment.
Yeah!
Man, you kids don't have
a care in the world.
Gon's team of five has passed the trial,
with three wins and two losses.
However, they must spend the fifty-hour
penalty in this small room.
They're running out of time.
Next time: Last x Test Of x Resolve!
Think like a fish!
You can do that?
Yep!
﻿Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

Last x Test Of x Resolve
During the exam's Third Phase,
which requires applicants to
reach Trick Tower's base
within seventy-two hours,
Gon and his friends have incurred
a penalty of fifty hours.
Meanwhile...
Gerreta, applicant #384,
is the fourth to pass.
Total time, twelve hours
and twenty-seven minutes.
Eh...
Not bad, I guess.
If you hesitate on the first step,
you'll hurt yourself.
Got it.
Hey, Kurapika.
Once we've spent fifty hours here,
we'll have fewer than ten hours, right?
Yes, that's correct.
That's way more than enough time!
You're a fool.
What's that?
Phase Three lasts seventy-two hours.
And each phase is designed to weed out
half of the remaining candidates.
So, on average, it's meant to
take seventy-two hours.
Just more proof that you're an idiot.
Well, our chances of reaching
the goal within ten hours
will depend on the remaining trials.
Yeah, that's true.
But when we've got a guy
who's so down on his luck,
he can't even win a simple game
of rock-paper-scissors...
What was that?!
You deliberately lost a bet,
just to satiate your libido.
Then you chose rock-paper-scissors,
a contest you couldn't win.
Shut up!
You surrendered without even a fight!
I...
I give!
Sure, I surrendered.
But I only wasted a second of our time.
You lost,
squandering fifty of our remaining hours.
Take some responsibility, huh?
Besides, what kind of Hunter
is so bad at gambling?
Shut up!
You don't even want to become a Hunter...
You only care about ruining our chances.
And now, you'll have
the guilt eating at you
for the rest of this exam phase.
Hey! What are you doing?
Sorry about that.
Don't skateboard inside this tiny room!
Aww...
Can't sleep?
That's not it.
I can go two or three days
without sleep.
Ten hours have passed, huh...
There aren't any windows,
so it's hard to tell.
But it's probably morning.
Most likely.
Hey, pipe down.
Let me sleep some more...
That stinks!
What's wrong with you guys?
That wasn't funny.
Bastard, you'd better not
be pretending to sleep.
Damn, now I'm totally awake...
And we still have forty hours left?
Oh, I thought you just had
to stick bait on a hook,
and you could fish.
Yeah.
You have to think like a fish.
Think like a fish?
Yep!
How would a fish feel if it saw
bait dangling in front of it?
Give me that.
Wow!
Let me try.
Like this?
You missed.
Just watch.
H-Hey...
What are you doing?
Hey...
Just as planned!
Nice.
Hey, you'll tear my pants.
Stop it...
See? I caught him.
Yep.
What's that supposed to mean?
I'm a fish now?!
You don't have to get so mad.
It's not like I'm gonna grill and eat you.
Don't mess with me, fool!
Man, I can't even take a nap.
What are you smiling about?
Nothing, really.
You must be up to something again.
Of course not.
I just want to spend
the rest of my time here peacefully.
Liar!
I don't trust you, got it?
The feeling's mutual.
Yes, the goal!
Pokkle, applicant #53.
Goz, applicant #371.
Both arrived simultaneously.
Total time, thirty hours
and four minutes.
Damn.
Old timer...
In a tie, the applicant with
the lower number wins.
These guys must be very skilled.
I would love to fight them eventually.
You lost,
squandering fifty of our remaining hours.
Take some responsibility, huh?
Ow!
One more hour...
Sommy, applicant #118,
is the thirteenth to pass.
Total time, sixty-one hours
and fifty-four minutes.
Man, still ten hours left?
I finished too early.
Okay...
Ready to go!
One more minute.
This is one long minute.
Ah...
Wait up, Gon!
Hunter Vocabulary
Bored
Thirty minutes of running,
just to end up where we started.
We should have taken those stairs down.
Shut up!
We all agreed on this route!
Man, I'm covered in dust.
H-Hurry up.
We only have an hour left...
We're supposed to vote on
whether to open the door?
We need to move on. So obviously,
we want to open the door.
I've had enough of your crap.
Wait, I pressed O.
Don't lie...
You specialize in ruining
other people's chances!
Sorry, Leorio.
Eh?
I accidentally pressed the wrong button.
What?
Oh, I see.
Wait.
Huh?
You owe me an apology.
I can't let that slide.
It's your own fault,
for doing things to make me distrust you.
I don't owe you anything.
You make it sound like I'm to blame
for everything that's gone wrong.
What?
Have you forgotten
who cost us those fifty hours?
You're the one who made
a critical mistake.
Hey, Leorio...
Shut up, Kurapika!
Stop this, guys.
It's my fault for pressing
the wrong button.
Stupid.
I'm moving on.
Wait, Killua!
Hey, Gon...
We're getting close to the goal.
What? Really?
Let's see...
"This will be the last decision
made by majority rule.
Are you ready?
Choose O or X."
That's it.
Am I ready?
You bet.
Bastard...
Stop!
We don't have time to argue about this!
Please select a path.
There are two choices.
One path allows five to pass,
but is long and difficult.
The other path allows only three,
but is short and easy.
Incidentally, the long and difficult path
requires a minimum of forty-five hours.
The short and easy path leads
to the goal in approximately three minutes.
Press O for the long and difficult path,
and X for the short and easy path.
If X is selected,
two people must be secured to
the wall with handcuffs,
before the door will open.
The two chained members
will be unable to move until
the time limit expires.
The examiners were very prepared.
I think they have
every weapon under the sun here.
Two out of five...
So we're supposed to fight,
to decide the three who pass?
Let me make this clear.
I'm going to press X.
But I have no intention of staying behind.
I'll do whatever it takes to
be one of the three...
You're shameless.
Had you not wasted fifty hours,
we could have taken the long path.
Shouldn't you take responsibility
and stay behind?
What?!
I'm sure everyone else agrees!
Have I said anything inaccurate?
Hold on.
I'm going to press O.
We made it all the way here together.
I want us all to pass together.
Gon...
Even if it's a big risk,
I want to give it a shot!
Come on...
You can't really call this a risk.
We have less than an hour.
Gon, there's only one choice
if you want to pass this exam.
There you have it.
Now we have to decide how to
choose which three pass.
Well, I'm planning on
two of them being you and me.
Heh, I've made it this far.
I won't fail now.
Whoever makes the first move wins.
Must we really fight amongst ourselves?
Tonpa, that was dirty!
In a fight,
there's no such thing as dirty!
Bastard!
Stop this, you two!
Come on... Let's do it together.
Before we start fighting,
we have to choose O or X!
It's too late for that!
Time to put you in your place!
Right back at you.
Seems our only choice is to fight.
What should I do?
Three minutes remain.
It's finally over...
Yeah, that took forever.
Made it in time...
He's dead.
The fool.
Better to live and try again,
than to pass and die.
One minute remains.
Looks like it'll just be
the nineteen here.
Kurapika, applicant #404,
is the twentieth to pass.
Killua, applicant #99,
is the twenty-first to pass.
Gon, applicant #405,
is the twenty-second to pass.
Total time, seventy-one hours
and fifty-nine minutes.
My butt hurts...
I didn't expect a slide
for the short and easy path.
Three of them...
Thirty seconds remain.
That was really close.
My hands are covered with blisters.
Same here.
Leorio, applicant #403,
is the twenty-third to pass.
Tonpa, applicant #16,
is the twenty-fourth to pass.
Total time, seventy-one hours
and fifty-nine minutes.
My hands are blistered,
but all five of us cleared
the tower together.
All thanks to Gon!
We entered the long and difficult path.
Then cut a hole in the wall,
to sneak into the short and easy path.
Man, I can't believe
you actually came up with
that idea on the spot.
I realized that we could break
the walls, using the weapons.
But it took over fifty minutes.
In an extreme situation,
you were able to calmly evaluate
our two options and circumvent them.
That's what makes you special.
The Third Phase of the exam is over.
Twenty-five applicants have passed.
One has died.
Though the team members
had their differences,
Gon was able to bring them together,
to overcome the trial.
However, a friend today may
become a foe tomorrow.
Gon doesn't know that before long,
they'll be pitted
against each other,
in brutal, individual battles.
Next time: Letter x From x Gon!
Now I'm worried.
Because of me?

"Mito-san and Grandma,
how are you doing?
I'm doing fine.
I just passed the Hunter
Exam's Third Phase.
Isn't that great?
But it's been a tough ride.
First, after leaving the island,
the boat I was on ran into a big storm.
But that's where I met
Leorio and Kurapika."
You can't buy class with money, Leorio.
That's three times now.
Step outside.
I'll end the filthy Kurta bloodline,
here and now.
Take that back, Leorio!
Take that back!
That's Leorio-san to you.
Take back what you said!
Take back your words,
and I'll forgive you, Leorio.
How many times must I repeat myself?
You should show me some respect.
I won't back down.
Then I have no choice...
Damn it!
Thanks, Gon!
You saved my life.
I couldn't have done it alone.
These two helped save you.
Huh?
Thank you very much!
No, you don't need to thank me.
Well...
Yeah, I'm glad you're okay.
Yeah! So I'll be returning to my station!
What?
I apologize for my rude behavior.
Sorry, Leorio-san.
Wh-What's with the sudden change?
We sound like strangers...
Just call me Leorio... Leorio works.
I'm also sorry.
I take back everything I said.
I was wrong.
"This led to the three of us traveling to
the Hunter Exam site together.
But the journey wasn't so simple."
Exciting two-choice quiz!
Here is your question...
Your son and daughter have
been kidnapped.
You can only rescue one.
Select 1 for your son,
or 2 for your daughter.
Which will you rescue?
She's making fun of us...
Don't stop me, Kurapika!
I won't be satisfied until I've
taught this hag a lesson!
Calm down, Leorio!
How am I supposed to calm down?
You'll waste our correct response!
Correct response?
We gave the right answer.
Silence was the correct response.
Please...
Please save my wife...
Leorio, we'll leave the
injured man to you!
Kurapika!
Who are you?
How can you tell that I'm
not the same one?
Huh?
Your face is completely different.
And your voice is a little
higher and thinner.
What?
Did I say something funny?
Your superhuman physical ability
and powers of observation
make you worthy to take the Hunter Exam.
You pass.
"Finally, the Hunter Exam began!"
I apologize for the wait.
The entry period for
Hunter applicants has ended.
The Hunter Exam will now begin!
You must follow me to Phase Two.
This is the exam's First Phase.
"That's when I made friends
with a boy around my age,
named Killua."
Hey, how old are you?
I'm twelve years old.
Hmm...
We're the same age.
Huh?
Guess I'll run, too.
Wow!
That was cool!
I'm Killua.
I'm Gon.
Hey, why do you want to
become a Hunter?
Me?
I'm not really interested in
becoming a Hunter.
Huh?
I heard the exam was supposed
to be really hard,
so I thought it'd be fun.
But this is disappointing.
What about you?
Well, my dad's a Hunter.
So I want to become a Hunter,
like my dad.
Hmm...
What kind of Hunter is he?
I don't know.
That's kinda weird.
Really?
You want to be like your dad,
but you don't know anything about him?
I was raised by Mito-san,
so I've only seen my dad in pictures.
Who's Mito-san?
Aunt Mito.
Oh...
When he was twelve,
my dad took the Hunter Exam.
He passed and became a Hunter.
Then he left the island.
I want to find out why he
chose to be a Hunter
over being with me.
The exit!
Whew...
Goal!
Yay! I win!
What are you talking about?
I was faster...
Now, I'll go over the rules of the game.
If you can take this ball from me,
before the airship reaches
its destination, you win.
It's mine!
I commend you on your efforts.
"Thanks to Killua,
the Hunter Exam's been a lot of fun.
We're best friends now."

What a fascinating weapon.
Allow me a closer look.

me!
You came to rescue your friend?
Such a good boy.
And that expression...
Very nice.
I'm getting excited now...
How wonderful...
I really do love that look.
Do not fear.
I will not kill your friend.
He passed.
Yes, you pass, as well.
Grow up and become a fine Hunter.
But I was pretty excited, as well.
I was so scared, I wanted to run away.
But I couldn't.
And at the same time, I was excited.
Isn't that strange?
"At the start of the Hunter Exam,
there were 404 applicants.
But by the time we reached
the Third Phase,
only 41 were left."
Ahem...
Everyone, the exam's Third Phase
will begin here,
at the top of Trick Tower.
Trick Tower?
To pass this phase,
you must reach the tower's base alive.
The time limit is seventy-two hours.
Wh-What is this place?
Look over there.
Allow me to explain, gentlemen.
Before you are some of
Trick Tower's prisoners.
The Hunter Exam Committee
has also officially hired them
as examiners.
You will be fighting against
the five of them.
There's too much at stake
without knowing
what they have up their sleeves.
Given that, I shall...
No, I'll go!
Tonpa-san?
Let the fight begin!
I...
I give!
Huh?
What?
Did he just give up?
M-Maybe he meant "Give me a sec"?
We each light a candle
at the same time.
The one whose candle goes
out first is the loser.
Hey! Look at Gon's candle!
The flame suddenly became stronger!
He must have hidden gunpowder or some other
highly flammable substance inside,
to make the candle burn faster!
If the fire is stronger,
then a little breeze won't extinguish it.
He's fast!
I win!

Huh?
Wh-What?
Right! In that case, we'll use
rock-paper-scissors!
A bet on who'll win a game
of rock-paper-scissors!
What?
It's so obvious what you'll use.
I can read minds.
Liar!
Your bluffing won't scare me!
You'll believe me soon enough.
Let's do this!
Rock...

Well? What will you use next?
Think hard.
Come on.
Damn!
Man, I have no idea what to think!
Here we go!
Here...
comes the...
draw!
I win!
How are we settling this contest?
Contest?
I believe you're confused.
This will be a one-sided massacre.
I have no interest in the exam
or any offer of amnesty.
I just want to hear you scream.
Really? Okay.
Then the loser is the one who dies.
Yeah, that's right.
I'll tear your body apart.
That's...
mine.
G-Give it back.
Please select a path.
There are two choices.
One path allows five to pass,
but is long and difficult.
The other path allows only three,
but is short and easy.
I'm going to press O.
We made it all the way here together.
I want us all to pass together.
Gon...
Even if it's a big risk,
I want to give it a shot!
We entered the long and difficult path.
Then cut a hole in the wall,
to sneak into the short and easy path.
My butt hurts...

The Third Phase of the exam is over.
Twenty-five applicants have passed.
One has died.
"And so,
I've completed the exam's
Third Phase, Mito-san.
I don't know how many are left,
but I'll pass them all
and become a Hunter, just like Dad.
Until next time,

Hit x The x Target
The twenty-four applicants who have passed
the exam's Third Phase
exit Trick Tower, one by one,
for a long-awaited breath of fresh air.
Ladies and gentlemen, congratulations
on having escaped Trick Tower.
Only the Fourth Phase and
the Final Phase remain.
Two more...
The Fourth Phase will take place
over there, on Zevil Island.
Let us proceed.
I will need you to draw lots.
Lots?
For what?
To determine who will hunt
and who will be hunted.
In here are twenty-four numbered cards.
In other words, your ID numbers
are on the cards.
Now, I need you each to draw a card,
in the order by which you
exited the tower.
Will the first person come forward?
Guess I'm next.
I'm next.
Hey, Killua.
Huh?
He said something about hunting
and being hunted.
Does that mean we'll be
fighting each other?
Yeah, probably.
I don't know what this is all about,
but I draw with style...
Everyone's taken a card?
Then, remove the seal from your card.
The card indicates your target.
This box has recorded which card
each of you drew.
This means that you're free
to dispose of the cards if you wish.
The objective
is to steal your target's ID tag.
Oh, so we don't need to kill each other.
Naturally, you're free to use
any method you choose
to steal the ID tags.
Including killing your target and
taking the tag off the corpse.
That sounds like the fastest way.
S-So that's what this is about?
Fool, there's nothing to be scared of.
Listen carefully!
Your target's ID tag is worth three points.
Your own ID is also worth three points.
All other ID tags are worth one point.
You need six points to advance
to the Final Phase.
So while on Zevil Island,
you must gather enough ID tags
to total six points.
That is the condition for clearing
the Hunter Exam's Fourth Phase.
I'd like to commend everyone on board
for their excellent work during the
Hunter Exam's Third Phase!
I will serve as your guide.
My name is Khara!
It will take two hours for
this boat to reach Zevil Island.
All twenty-four applicants remaining here
are automatically qualified
to take next year's exam!
So if you fail this year, don't feel bad.
Please try again next year...
Th-This is so depressing.
The battle has already begun.
Yeah, everyone's removed their ID tags,
and hid them.
Well, you're free to do as you like,
for the next two hours.
Please enjoy the boat ride.
Speaking hypothetically...
If you happened to be my target,
I wouldn't show any mercy.
Naturally.
If you happened to be my target,
I would say the same.
Am I your target?
I was speaking hypothetically.
Oh, right...
Don't worry.
You are not my target.
I-I see...
And you aren't my target!
Yo.
What number did you draw?
How about you?
Secret.
Don't worry.
You aren't my target.
And my target isn't you.
Show each other our numbers
at the same time?
Okay!
Ready, and...
#44 is...
Seriously?
You have really bad luck...
You think so?
Who's #199?
You don't know, either?
Uh-uh.
I didn't bother to memorize
everyone's numbers.
After the initial explanation,
I started checking tags,
but everyone had already removed them.
That's so lame...
Gon...
Huh?
What?
Are you happy?
Or scared?
Both, I guess...
In a straight-up fight,
I wouldn't stand a chance.
But if I only need to steal his ID tag,
then I have a real shot.
Yeah.
Right now,
I might actually have a chance.
That scares me a little...
But I think it's worth it.
I see.
Well, let's do our best.
Make sure you stay alive, Gon.
Uh-huh!
You, too.
Thanks for your patience, everyone.
We've finally arrived at Zevil Island!
Now, please disembark in the order by which
you cleared the Third Phase.
Tsk...
This again.
After each person disembarks,
we'll wait two minutes before
the next person's turn.
That means we'll be waiting
here a while.
Yeah.
You will stay on this island
for exactly one week.
During that time,
you must amass your six points
of ID tags and return here.
All right then, the first person may start!
I understand...
Those who disembark earlier
hold the advantage.
Yeah.
They can hide and monitor
their target's movements.
Two minutes have passed.
The second person may start!
The third person may start.
Yeah!
The seventh person...
The eleventh person...
The fifteenth person...
The twentieth person may start.
Two minutes have passed.
The twenty-first person may start!
See ya.
Uh-huh.
Well,
guess I'll begin by scouting the island.
Two minutes have passed.
The twenty-second person may start.
Okay!
See you...
Yeah!
First, I need to find Hisoka!
Hunter Vocabulary
Zevil Island
How do I steal Hisoka's ID tag?
Such a good boy.
Very nice.
I'm getting excited now...
I won't be able to steal his tag
with a head-on attack...
It's another applicant.
And another one is behind him.
He's targeting the guy in front.
He blew it!
Hey, that was close.
Sorry, but it won't be that easy...
That easy...
Wh-What?
B-Bastard...
The arrow was coated with
a fast acting tranquilizer.
You won't be able to walk
for the next week.
Don't worry.
There's water nearby.
You won't die.
I'll be taking this.
See ya.
Wow.
He was able to mask his own presence
as he stalked his prey.
And his target was able to
sense the shot being fired,
and quickly dodge it,
avoiding serious injury.
However,
the other applicant anticipated this,
and poisoned his arrow...
This is how you hunt!
If I have any chance at
stealing Hisoka's ID tag,
this is it!
First, I have to sneak up on him
without being noticed.
Then I wait for my chance,
and steal his tag!
Yeah!
But unlike this target,
Hisoka will be moving...
Regardless, I'll only get one shot.
I have to hook Hisoka's tag
when he isn't paying attention.
Okay...
Read his movements...
Now!
Hmm...
This isn't quite right...
It's too easy to predict
how a swinging target will move.
That's right.
I shouldn't forget that Hisoka will
try to move out of the way.
If I can't get a bird
by watching how it moves,
I'll never be able to steal Hisoka's ID!
Huh?
Oh, well!
I won't catch a bird on the
first or second try.
There!
Whose number is this?
The sun's about to set...
I should probably stay in one place
until tomorrow morning.
Damn...
I didn't think it would be so hard.
It's too dark for me to see anything.
And all the birds are gone...
Okay...
I'll catch one tomorrow!
Right!
Back to training!
It's no use.
Maybe it's not possible, after all.
To catch a bird,
with accuracy, while it's in flight...
Birds can catch fish that are swimming.
Go!
I get it...
There's a moment
when I know exactly what
my target will do next!
Now!
I did it!
I figured it out!
I have to aim for my target as
he hunts his own prey!
Heh.
He actually mastered
the art of hunting.
Impressive little boy...
But that intense concentration
will be your undoing.
Gon finally mastered the trick that
would help him hunt Hisoka.
However, Gon was also being hunted.
Next time: Explosion x Of x Deception!
Explode!
Explode...
Ka-boom!
Oh, mushroom.

The word "unknown" holds magic.
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.
They are known...

Now!
I did it!
I figured it out!
I have to aim for my target as
he hunts his own prey!
Explosion x Of x Deception
Zevil Island, day two.
Gon has learned the technique
which will enable him to
capture his target.
Ow!
My hands are all bloody...
I've been swinging my fishing
rod for two straight days.
But now, I have perfect accuracy,
catching birds as they swoop
after their prey.
If I utilize this technique properly,
I'll be able to steal Hisoka's tag.
All that's left is to find Hisoka!
Ow...
But how am I supposed to find Hisoka?
I guess I'll just have to walk around,
and trust my instincts.
What?
Why are they gathering around me?
These butterflies...
They're attracted to the scent of blood.
Hisoka,
have you taken your target's tag?
No, not yet.
You don't even know who
your target is, do you?
No.
Want me to tell you?
No, it doesn't matter.
I'll just find three others to hunt.
I remember that, back at the tower,
Hisoka was injured.
If this works, the butterflies
might lead me to him.
Ah...
It's the guy who was grazed
by the arrow.
Better luck next year!
There he is!
Stay calm...
Stay calm!
I just need to wait.
For Hisoka to make his move.
Man, where is everyone hiding?
I haven't seen anyone for
the past two days.
Who's there?
Oh, hold on!
It's just me...
Tonpa!
Don't tell me that your target is...
Hey, wait a second!
Just calm down.
You aren't my target.
Prove it.
Right...
Here.
Good thing I didn't throw it away.
Fighting people who aren't my target
is a waste of time and energy.
Don't tell me that I'm your target!
Unfortunately, you're not.
#246.
Ponzu, huh?
Huh?
You know who this is?
You didn't already know?
Uh, er, well...
I wouldn't put it that way.
I just didn't have a chance
to find out...
Heh.
Want me to fill you in?
What?
Your target's appearance, weapons,
special abilities, and weaknesses.
However, I have one condition.
Huh?
I think I ate some bad fruit.
Bad fruit...
To be honest, I can barely stand...
You want to become a doctor, right?
Do you have any medicine on you?
I got it...
Don't soil yourself.
I have all kinds of anti-diarrheal
and stomach medicine.
Oh...
Thank you so much!
First, tell me what you know.
F-Fine...
Ponzu is a female applicant.
Female?
As far as I know,
five of the remaining
twenty-four applicants
use some sort of chemical weapon.
Ponzu is one of those.
So she's the one.
This girl happens to
specialize in all kinds of drugs.
But her strategy is simple...
Hide and wait.
Hide and wait?
She sets a trap and waits for
her target to show up.
I see...
You shouldn't have to worry
about anything else.
If you make it a close-quarters fight,
you're guaranteed to win.
If you find her,
watch your footing, and note which
direction the wind is blowing.
Sh-She's fully aware that
someone else
is targeting her.
Th-That's pretty much it.
G-Give me the medicine...
Okay.
To be safe, back up a bit.
H-Hurry...
I-I can't hold it in!
Damn!
Your tag is mine.
I knew you were keeping your
tag in your suitcase.
Tonpa!
You two are working together?
Exactly so.
I didn't need your medicine.
I have my own.
And I might as well confess
that you actually are my target.
Wh-What about the card you
just showed me?
That's my target.
This is Tonpa's.
We swapped cards.
And you fell for our little trick...
There you have it.
Damn you!
I'll make you pay!
Uh-oh...
Tonpa!
We'll meet at the usual place!
Gotcha!
Hold up!
I'm gonna kill you!
Hey, now...
I'm not the one with your tag!
Shut up!
Good grief...
You still haven't learned
your lesson, rookie?
What was that?
It's your own fault for letting us trick you!
Besides,
working in teams during the
Hunter Exam is common sense!
I agree with the latter,
but I cannot accept the former.
Huh?
You shouldn't be tricking people,
in the first place!
Kurapika...
Leorio, want to team up?
Hunter Vocabulary
Target
Please Do Not Feed!!
Hey!
Return my tag!
If you want it back, catch me.
Okay!
I retrieved my tag.
And we have the tags for
#16 and #118, as well.
So, Kurapika,
Tonpa was your target?
You saved me back there.
You needn't thank me.
I didn't want Tonpa to notice me,
so I stayed hidden
while you were jumped from behind.
What?
Well, that was because
I figured there'd be no point in teaming up
with you if you couldn't
withstand that attack.
I suppose that you barely qualified.
You really are full of yourself...
Well,
I can't deny that it's easier
to work as a team.
Let's stick together for the
remaining four days.
Yes.
You got your target's tag.
So with your own, that adds
up to six points.
Assuming he doesn't take it back.
The #118 tag is only worth
one point for either of us.
But it might still come in handy.
Next, we need to find your target,
#246, Ponzu.
Stay alert, in case we're being followed.
You shouldn't be talking.
Yeah, yeah.
You're absolutely right.
I know you've been following me
since the exam began.
You fail at hiding.
Show yourself.
Let's play.
Well, come on out.
I know you're there.
He noticed me?
If you won't come out, I'll come to you.
I guess that's it...
In that case, it's all or nothing.
When did he arrive?
I challenge you to a duel.
You'll die.
This is my chance!
My chance is about to come...
In the moment Hisoka goes
to finish off his prey!
Why?
Why isn't Hisoka fighting back?
Hisoka, explain yourself...
Why won't you attack me?
If I continue to avoid your attacks,
you'll die eventually.
I can tell from the swarm of
Hemotropic Butterflies
that your wounds are grave.
Someone else has already dealt
you a fatal blow, yes?
Though I do understand your
desire to die in battle.
If you...
If you understand so well,
why do you still refuse to fight me?!
I have no interest in the dead.
What?
I'm not yet...
You're already dead.
It's in your eyes.
Bye-bye.
Sorry about that.
I carelessly let him escape.
Liar.
He probably begged you to grant him
one final wish, yes?
Well, I felt sorry for the guy.
Given that he was dead either way.
You should cease pitying enemies
who serve no purpose.
You've done it before, haven't you?
You've walked away from opponents
before finishing them.
I have standards.
I'm not interested in people
who have no purpose.
I only spare those whose deaths
would go to waste.
What about his tag?
Oh, I already took it.
I have six points now,
so I don't need this one.
You can have it.
Whose tag is this?
It belonged to some guy
who tried to snipe me.
He ticked me off, so I killed him.
Well, then...
This is always so fascinating to watch.
It's pretty hard on me...
I feel much better.
Well, I'll just sleep here
until the final day.
Good luck.
It's completely dark now.
Keep your guard up.
Night provides the perfect chance for
someone to attack their target.
I know that.
Well, I need two more points.
I suppose I should go hunt someone...
I'll get him this time!
Found you...
Hisoka targets Kurapika and Leorio.
Gon targets Hisoka's ID tag.
Four days remain before the
exam's Fourth Phase ends.

Defeat x And x Disgrace
Hisoka targets Kurapika and Leorio.
Gon targets Hisoka's ID tag.
In the silence of the night,
something is surely about to happen...
Now!
Oh, it's them...
Amusing.
Hisoka has found his prey.
Leorio! Kurapika!
I didn't expect him to go
after Leorio and Kurapika.
What should I do?
Don't stop!
Stick to the plan,
and when Hisoka attacks his prey,
go for the ID tag!
That's my only chance to take Hisoka's tag!
No, I can't just ignore them.
If they start fighting, I'll change plans.
So I've figured out who my target is,
but how am I supposed to find her
on this huge island?
Isn't walking around aimlessly
a waste of energy?
Constantly whining would be
an even bigger waste of energy.
You already have six points,
so you're finished.
But if I don't find my target...
Hey.
Hisoka!
Imagine meeting you here...
I keep running into people
I don't want to encounter.
You see,
I need two more points.
Could you give me your tags?
What was that?!
Screw that! I'm not gonna...
Leorio!
You said that you need
two additional points.
Which implies that we
are not your targets,
correct?
I'm the one who's asking
the questions here.
Will you give me your tags or not?
That depends.
We currently have four tags.
Mine, my target's, Leorio's,
and a tag worth only a single point to us.
Of these,
only two could be the number of your target.
Mine, or the tag only worth a single point.
Leorio's number is #403.
He was the target of #16, Tonpa.
And my target was #16.
Each person was assigned
a different target,
so #16 and #403 are out.
Indeed...
Neither of those is my target.
So?
That leaves the other two tags.
If you're willing to take the tag worth
only one point to us and leave,
you can have it.
Huh?
But I will not let you have mine.
And the same goes for the other two.
If you insist on taking them by force,
you'll have to fight me!
Out of curiosity, what is your number?
#404.
Very well.
You have a deal.
I'll only take the one tag.
I'll leave it here.
Don't worry.
I'll be standing here for a while.
In only a few days,
they've grown so much,
I barely recognize them.
But they have much more to learn...
Why must unripe fruit
be so tantalizing?
A pity.
This is the wrong tag...
Whew...
But now I only have one more chance.
When Hisoka locates his next prey.
Wait!
What if the next person Hisoka finds
doesn't fight him either?
That's right!
If that person also hands over a tag,
I won't get another chance!
I'm so stupid!
I never even considered that!
I'm scared...
No more.
I don't want to be here!
I can sense his blood lust from here...
Uh-oh.
Those boys got me all tingly...
I must calm it.
Okay.
Time to go.
I can do this!
His blood lust has calmed,
but the look in his eyes
doesn't even compare to before.
I'm certain he'll attack
the next person he sees,
even if that person surrenders.
I know!
I should move ahead and
locate his next prey!
I also need to find a good spot
from which to steal his tag...
There!
At this rate, Hisoka will spot him
in the next minute.
I have to figure out where
their paths will cross...
Over there!
I've gotta hurry.
Hisoka will attack,
as soon as he notices that guy.
This is my chance to steal his tag...
My last chance!
Hunter Vocabulary
Chance
Hisoka has completely
hidden his presence.
Oh, no! He's going to notice me!
I have to conceal my presence, too.
Completely conceal my...
presence.
Here he comes!
Hisoka!
Damn... Bring it!
He's going to fight back.
I did it...
I took Hisoka's tag!
Approximately, seven thousand.
Do you know what that
number represents?
The number of chances
I had to kill you.
It's also the number of times you swung
your fishing rod when you were training.
You were completely open
when you were swinging your rod.
But I admit that I admired your
concentration and accuracy.
That swing just now was
especially impressive.
But you didn't pay attention to
your own surroundings.
Next time, remember to
watch your own back.
So long.
Damn it...
You surprise me.
You hid your presence,
while waiting for your chance?
Waiting for me to attack another?
Did you teach yourself how
to conceal your presence?
Marvelous...
Like a wild animal.
And your timing was impeccable.
You concealed all traces of your attack
by timing it with my own attack.
A splendid job.
His poison darts completely
relax your muscles.
The effects last ten days
in a normal person.
Only three days are left.
I'm sure you will have
recovered by then.
Wait...
Didn't you come to take back your tag?
No, I just came to commend you.
Turns out that he was my target.
So I don't need that anymore.
I don't need it, either.
Don't say that...
You owe me one now.
Feel free to pay me back when you want.
Goodbye.
I don't want to owe anyone...
You can have it back now.
I refuse.
Right now, I'm letting you live.
And I'll continue to keep you alive,
until you've grown enough
to be worth killing...
I'll only take it back
when you're able to punch me
in the face, just like that.
Until then, I shall leave the tag with you.
Gon was completely helpless
against Hisoka,
who knocked him out
with a single blow.
What must he be thinking,
alone in the darkness?
Next time: Trap x In The x Hole!
The end... the end...

Trap x In The x Hole
Gon was humiliated,
after Hisoka recovered the tags
taken by Gerreta.
As for Killua...
You're wasting your time.
I'll never give you an opening to attack.
Tremble with fear.
Wear yourself out.
I am a very cautious man.
I go to any lengths necessary,
even when facing a child.
Once he exhausts himself,
and has no choice but to sleep,
I'll attack!
I am a very cautious man.
Man...
If you're not gonna show yourself,
I'll come to you.
Huh?
What a pain...
You're only worth one point to me.
He wants to fight?
I can't possibly lose, right?
He's just a kid.
But...
Why is he so calm?
Is he really that strong?
Right... I am a very cautious man.
I should esca—
I mean, I should back off.
But...
My brothers will yell at me!
Actually, if I go back without
taking his tag,
they'll definitely yell at me!
Bro!
We ran into some trouble.
You're done, right?
You idiot!
You can't even beat a little kid?
Y-You got it wrong, Amo!
What do I have wrong?
I-I didn't want to hurt a little kid.
So I figured I'd take it while he slept.
You're lying through your teeth!
F-Fine!
If you insist, that leaves me no choice.
Time for a beat down.
If I start to lose,
my brothers will come to my aid.
Hey, kid.
Just give me your tag.
Do as I say, and I won't hurt you.
Stupid.
Aw, don't say I didn't warn you.
Right in the gut.
Must hurt like a bitch.
Huh?
What?
Did you go easy on him?
You're too nice, Imori.
Y-Yeah...
#198, huh?
What? No way...
Since it's only a number off
from the one I'm after,
maybe #199 is one of your two buddies?
Umori...
Yeah.
Get in formation.
Time to get serious.
This is no ordinary kid.
It doesn't matter how strong he is.
He stands no chance
against our teamwork.
We three have
defeated many tough opponents
with this formation.
Just you wait...
We're gonna rip you to shreds.
A-Above?
Don't move.
My fingers are sharper than knives.
Huh?
You're #197?
I'm so bad at guessing these things...
Hey.
Are you #199?
Yeah...
Hand it over.
Thanks.
Now, for the tags I don't need...
And the other one goes this way.
You still have three days.
Good luck finding them.
See ya.
Damn it!
#197 was always accompanied by #199...
I didn't expect that little kid to
deal with them for me.
Good thing I was watching
from the shadows.
Made it easy to grab the tag I wanted...
The kid noticed I was there...
I've failed...
Man, that was boring.
Wonder what Gon's doing.
Hunter Vocabulary
Too Bad
Six days have passed.
Only one day left...
It's been four days since
we ran into Hisoka.
And we haven't seen anyone else.
Wanna head back to the starting point?
It's possible that people have
already finished.
No, we won't find anyone there.
This phase is unique because
you have a chance to recover
your tag if you lose it.
On the other hand,
you might have six points
in tags right now.
But that doesn't guarantee you'll have
them when the phase ends.
You can't finish it early.
I see.
But it's worth a shot.
Only one day remains.
People who already have six points
will be inclined to wait near the goal.
I would do the same.
Okay, let's go.
Well? Anyone there?
No...
No one that can be easily spotted.
Damn...
Perhaps we should split up to search,
after we decide on a time and
place to reconvene.
It'll go faster with three people.
Gon!
I guess we all had the same idea.
I've been watching from up above,
and a number of people are nearby.
Really?
I see... We should search from above.
That won't work.
It's only possible if you have eyes
as sharp as Gon's.
Gon.
Huh?
Do you have the tags you need?
Yeah, I guess...
Damn, so I'm the only one
without enough points.
Who's your target?
#246, a woman named Ponzu.
I heard that she uses chemical weapons.
Gon, did you see any women
when you were up there?
Nope.
I see.
We can assume that there
are four possibilities.
She's in good shape,
and she still has her tag.
She's in good shape,
but she's lost her tag.
She's out of action,
but she still has her tag.
She's out of action,
and she doesn't have her tag.
Is it really likely
that she'd still have her tag
if she's out of action?
If she were caught in a sudden accident,
or if she were defeated after
hiding the tag.
If she died after concealing her tag,
we won't be able to find it.
Sounding grimmer by the second.
Hey, do you know anything
else about Ponzu?
Does she wear a special perfume,
like Leorio with his cologne?
Oh, that's right.
Gon can follow her scent!
But she might not wear perfume.
He can smell the chemicals she uses.
She's known for using drugs, right?
Some of them must have strong scents.
Well, Gon?
Okay, I'll give it a shot.
That's why I'm here.
Is she in there, Gon?
Yep, definitely.
What do you want to do?
I'm going inside.
You guys, wait here.
There don't appear to be any traps.
I'll head inside.
Don't enter until I give the okay.
Thirty minutes.
Huh?
If we don't hear anything from you
after thirty minutes,
we're coming in.
Yeah.
Unacceptable.
If that happens, you guys
should return to the start.
I can't do that.
Since we've teamed up,
I won't abandon you now.
Then I quit the team.
It's selfish, considering all the
help you've given me,
but I'll do this alone.
No.
What did you say?!
We're staying here, no matter
what you say.
Still got a problem?
Do whatever you want.
Hold onto that for me.
I have to go for it...
Isn't that...
Bourbon?
I'm guessing that
I'm your target?
Ponzu!
There's no point.
We gain nothing by fighting here.
I have everything to gain.
It's just as you said...
You're my target!
Let's pretend that a miracle occurs,
and you defeat me.
You still won't be able
to leave this cave.
What?
What do you mean?
He's taking too long.
Is Leorio okay?
Yeah.
It's been nearly thirty minutes.
Kurapika! Gon!
Don't come in!
Leorio!
Leorio!
You fools...
Why did you enter the cave?
He has bites all over his body!
If those snakes were venomous...
They're vipers.
Their poison isn't that strong.
But he's been bitten
too many times!
S-Stop it!
If you have any cavities or
open wounds in your mouth...
No problem!
Leorio, do you have any
serums in here?
If I did,
I could have saved you guys...
Leorio!
Anyway, we have to stop the bleeding.
Uh-huh!
That should do it.
We need to take him to a doctor!
I would stop if I were you.
You cannot leave.
What do you mean?
When someone tries to exit this cave,
snakes attack them.
Bourbon, the snake charmer,
set this trap.
If you're bitten,
you'll end up paralyzed like he is.
And then you'll die.
Bourbon!
You're looking for tags, right?
We'll give you every tag
in our possession.
So let us out of here!
It's no use.
He's already dead.
D-Dead?
Gon and his friends have
been caught in Bourbon
the snake charmer's trap,
and can't leave the cave.
Will they pass the Hunter Exam?
Will Leorio survive the
venomous snake bites?
Next time: Big x Time x Interview!
Thank you, Kurapika.
Thank you, Gon.

Big x Time x Interview
Gon's group has been trapped by
the vipers that block the exit.
But the vipers' master, Bourbon,
is already dead.
The one who set this trap is dead?
How?
I killed him.
I won't tell you how.
Gon, take Leorio.
Okay.
It's no use.
You won't be able to search his body.
The snakes are trained to attack
the moment anyone tries to touch
their master or to leave the cave.
So you used poison to fight poison.
Judging from his wounds,
you must have used Neurotoxic Bees.
He probably died from anaphylactic shock.
Anaphylactic shock?
When a bee stings a human,
the human produces antibodies
to counter the venom.
But if that human is stung again
by the same kind of bee,
they experience an allergic reaction.
An extreme allergic reaction
is known as anaphylactic shock.
Depending on the circumstances,
it can be fatal.
You got me.
That's exactly what happened.
So you used bees to kill him?
Bourbon was my target.
After confirming that he'd
entered the cave,
I sprayed sleeping gas into the entrance,
and waited until it was safe to enter.
Bourbon was sound asleep,
but he'd already set his trap.
The sleeping gas didn't reach
most of the snakes that were hiding
in cracks at the back of the cave.
Well, I jumped back in time,
so I wasn't bitten by snakes.
But that triggered my attack switch.
You keep bees up there?
If I scream or collapse,
they'll attack any nearby humans.
I didn't expect him to die.
How could I have known that he'd
already been stung once?
And I couldn't help him
because of the snakes.
Well, it was beyond my control anyway.
You can come back now.
The problem is that he's dead,
but the viper trap is still active.
And we can't ask him or
look for a way to disarm it.
We're trapped with no escape.
Leorio...
I've already given up.
We just have to wait for the
examiners to come and save us.
The examiners?
You're saying that they'll
rescue us from this cave?
You didn't know?
Our ID tags contain a tracking device.
The examiners can locate each applicant.
If someone hasn't returned
by the deadline,
the examiners will look for them.
Though this won't work if
you lose your tag
or if someone takes it from you.
Fortunately, there's only one day left.
The best course would be to give up
for this year and wait for help.
We cannot do that.
Leorio's condition is worsening.
We must take him to a
doctor immediately.
The examiners won't move until
the deadline passes.
If you don't have your tag,
you'll basically be left for dead.
It's his own fault.
I warned him.
Kurapika! Gon!
Don't come in! The snakes...!
All you can do is pray that he
holds out until help arrives.
No, there is still a way.
With a good chance for success.
But if he isn't carrying any on his person,
we'll have another victim.
Kurapika.
Look after Leorio.
Gon?
I'm sure we'll find some!
Gon...
Hey, Gon!
Wait, what are you doing?
Didn't you hear what I just said?
Hello?
Gon!
H-He's crazy...
Found it!
Kurapika!
Gon!
Use it on Leorio quick...
All right, you're next.
Yeah...
I don't believe it...
He jumped into a nest of
poisonous snakes
to search for an antidote,
not even knowing if he had it?
The odds were in his favor.
What?
If you're going to poison someone,
you'd need the antidote at hand,
as a bargaining chip.
That's true, but...
That said,
it took an incredible amount of courage
to do what he just did.
Leorio's condition is stabilizing.
He should be fine.
You must be really good friends.
Hey, do you have any sleeping gas left?
I do...
Would you trade it for this?
Ah!
That's Bourbon's!
This gives you six points, right?
Yes, that's right.
But what are you going to do
with the sleeping gas?
Put all the snakes to sleep,
so we can escape.
It'd be more effective than when
I sprayed the gas from outside.
Within five minutes, the entire
cave will fill with gas,
and the snakes will be asleep.
But it'll take five minutes!
No one can hold their breath that long.
There's no point if we put
ourselves to sleep in the process.
Nine minutes and forty-four seconds.
Huh?
That's my record.
I'll hold my breath and carry
everyone out of here.
I can't trust you.
You might escape by yourself.
You really think he'd do that,
after jumping into
a nest of poisonous snakes to save Leorio?
Trust me.
I'll get you out of here!
It's ready.
On my signal, release the gas.
Got it.
199, 200,
201, 202, 203,
204, 205, 206, 207...
Yes!
Well, I'll leave Bourbon's tag with you,
so the examiners will find you.
If I give Leorio your tag,
he'll have six points and pass.
Consider it the fee for carrying
you out of there.
Sorry.
The Fourth Phase of the exam
has just ended.
Will the applicants please return
to the starting point at once?
You will be given one hour of extra time.
If you do not return during this time,
you will fail the exam.
Furthermore, you are not allowed
to exchange tags
after reaching the starting point.
Anyone caught swapping tags
will be disqualified.
Hunter Vocabulary
Ponzu
Then we will now check the
tags of everyone here!
#44 Hisoka-san.
#53, Pokkle-san.
#99, Killua-san.
#301, Gittarackur-san.
#191, Bodoro-san.
#294, Hanzo-san.
So six applicants have passed?
Oh?
Gon.
Ah, three more arrive at the last second.
Killua.
And now for the last few members...
#404, Kurapika-san.
#403, Leorio-san.
And #405, Gon-san.
These nine applicants have passed
the Fourth Phase of the exam!
Six of the nine are rookies?
Marvelous, marvelous.
Has this ever happened before?
Hmm, there's a trend where
we'll go many years without
a single rookie qualifying.
Then suddenly,
we'll have a whole bunch
of promising newbies.
This is the fourth time I've seen it happen.
By the way, what are we doing
for the Final Phase?
Oh, right.
You haven't told us yet.
Yes, about that...
I intend to have them participate
in a rather peculiar fight.
Hmm? A rather peculiar fight?
First, I want to talk to each of the
nine remaining applicants.
Pathetic...
I needed the two of you
to do everything for me during
the Fourth Phase.
I promise I'll return the favor.
So...
Thanks.
I have an announcement for all applicants.
The chairman wishes to interview
the remaining candidates.
Interview?
When your number is called,
please come to the first reception room,
on the second floor.
Then we will start with #44, Hisoka-sama.
Well, have a seat.
Don't tell me that this is
the exam's Final Phase.
It may be related...
I'll just be asking a few questions
to satisfy my curiosity.
First, why do you want to
become a Hunter?
I'm not particularly interested in
becoming a Hunter, but...
But?
A Hunter License can be very useful.
Oh, any examples?
For example,
Hunters usually can't be punished
when they kill someone.
I see.
Then I'll move on to the next question.
Which of the other eight applicants
are you keeping an eye on?
#99.
Ah...
#405 is also on my radar,
but it's #99 I'm keeping an eye on.
I would love to take him on one day.
One last question.
Which of the other eight applicants
would you least want to fight?
That would be #405.
Though #99 is also up there.
If you're asking whom I least
want to fight at this moment,
my answer would be #405.
Ah, I understand.
I should mention that the one I most
want to fight at this moment
is you.
Yep, nice job.
You're excused.
That old man is too crafty...
He left himself so undefended,
I lost my edge.
I'm watching out for #404.
He looks to be the most
balanced applicant left.
I definitely don't want to fight #44.
To be honest, I doubt I can beat him.
Has to be Gon.
Since we're the same age.
I don't want to fight #53.
I don't think it'd be a
very interesting fight.
I've got my eye on #44.
He has real presence.
#405 and #99 are still children.
I couldn't bring myself to fight them.
#99.
#44.
Who am I watching out for?
#44, Hisoka.
A lot's happened, so I've
been watching him.
I can't choose one out of
#99, #403, and #404.
It has to be #44.
He's the most dangerous one here.
And #44 is the one I least want to fight.
I'm watching #405 for positive reasons,
and #44 for negative reasons.
If I'm given ample reason,
I'll fight anyone.
If not, I would prefer not to fight anyone.
#405.
I owe him, and I hope that
he passes the exam.
So I'm hoping I don't have to fight #405.
Hmm, the results were more lopsided
than I was expecting.
Gon.
We've reached the Final Phase
of the exam.
Yeah.
Heart
Yes, that's good.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I've drawn up the bracket.
Huh?
What is this?
Ch-Chairman?
What?
Are you serious about this?
Dead serious.
He certainly has a serious expression.
Th-That's a serious expression?
Winning will make them Hunters.
Gon...
Hmm?
Did something happen during
the Fourth Phase?
When we met up,
you were acting a little strange.
And you've been somewhat subdued
since we left Zevil Island.
My target was Hisoka.
I waited for the perfect chance
and stole his tag,
but someone else was tailing me,
and he got me with a poisoned dart.
Soon after, Hisoka took back his tag
from the person who got me,
and he left it with me.
He said that I owed him now.
Hisoka said that?
I told him I didn't need his help,
and he sent me flying.
I'll only take it back
when you're able to punch me
in the face, just like that.
I was so mad
that I couldn't do anything against him...
After that, I was pretty
miserable and lonely.
I felt so helpless,
I wanted company...
I wanted to help someone,
I guess.
That's why I was looking for you two.
Gon.
Leorio and I have only been able
to make it this far because of you.
We're truly grateful.
I'd also like to thank you.
Gon has deepened his bond
with his friends.
And the nine remaining
applicants are about
to begin the exam's Final Phase.
Next time: Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!
Then how am I supposed to win?
Just do it!
﻿Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
The word "unknown" holds magic.
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.
They are known...
...as Hunters!
What?
Are you serious about this?
Dead serious.
Those who win will join
the ranks of the Hunters.
Can't Win x And x Can't Lose
Nine applicants:
Gon, Killua, Kurapika,
Leorio, Pokkle, Bodoro,
Gittarackur, Hanzo, and Hisoka,
head to the Final Phase, having passed
the exam's Fourth Phase.
Well, gentlemen.
Did you get plenty of rest?
This hotel is owned by the
Hunter Exam Selection Committee.
The place is all yours until the
battles have concluded.
For the Final Phase, we will be
holding a one-on-one tournament.
So only the last person standing passes?
No.
One win is all you need to pass.
One win?
Then, in this tournament...
The winners are removed from competition,
while the losers continue up the bracket.
In other words, the person who
finishes at the top will not pass.
Does everyone understand now?
So you're saying that only
one person will fail.
Exactly.
And here is the bracket.
Impressive, right?
After all, everyone has at least
two chances to win.
But some people,
like #294 and #405, get five chances.
Why didn't you use a balanced bracket?
A question that must be on everyone's mind.
This bracket was assembled
based on your performances
throughout the entire exam.
Those who performed better
received more chances.
That doesn't sound right.
Can you explain how you
scored our performances?
No!
Why not?
Your scores are classified information.
So I can't tell you everything.
But I can explain our methods.
First, we consider three major criteria:
physical strength, mental strength,
and overall impression.
For physical strength, we use
an aggregate of agility,
flexibility, endurance, and perception.
For mental strength, we use
an aggregate of resilience,
adaptability, judgment, and creativity.
However, this information is only
used as a reference point.
After all, you were strong enough
to advance to the Final Phase.
However, we are most concerned
with your overall impression.
This refers to any intangible factors
not previously mentioned.
You could consider this
an evaluation of your potential as a Hunter.
And we also incorporate the
opinions of your peers.
That was our process.
Based on performance,
I should be ranked higher...
Do I have less potential than Gon?
The battle rules are quite simple.
Weapons are allowed.
No cheating.
If your opponent admits defeat, you win.
However!
If you kill your opponent,
you will be immediately disqualified.
All remaining applicants will pass,
and the exam will end.
Are we clear?
Then, we shall begin the exam's Final Phase.
The first match is Hanzo versus Gon.
Please step forward.
I will serve as the referee.
My name is Masta.
Best of luck.
Hey, good to see you again.
You were tailing me during the Fourth Phase.
You noticed?
Naturally...
I'm assuming that each applicant was
assigned an examiner for the Fourth Phase.
Well, I'm sure everyone else noticed.
I had no idea.
I obviously noticed.
I thought it wasn't worth mentioning.
Y-Yeah...
How was I supposed to notice that?
You have my thanks.
My rank was higher because your
reports on me were accurate.
Though the outcome was never in doubt!
Y-Yes...
Moving on,
I have a question for you.
What is it?
We only win if our opponent
surrenders, correct?
It doesn't count if we knock them unconscious.
No TKOs allowed, either.
Yes, that is correct.
I see.
This one could be difficult...
He looks tough, but we should be even
in terms of strength and speed.
I can use my speed to keep on the
move until I get an opening.
Now then, it's time to begin.
Get him, Gon!
How well can he do against Hanzo?
Begin!
Put some distance between us...
You must be confident in your legs.
You have my respect.
You did well for a kid.
Tsk.
I could have easily dodged that attack.
Well, this would already be over
if it were a normal fight...
Here, wake up.
You must feel terrible.
I hit you hard enough to make
your brain bounce around.
Do you understand?
You have no chance against me.
Might as well give up now...
No way...
Think about it.
If you surrender now, you'll still be in
decent shape for your next fight.
There's no reason to be stubborn.
Just surrender.
Never gonna happen!
Surrender.
Gon! Don't be silly!
You'll still have another chance!
You should...
Leorio!
If you were in Gon's position,
would you surrender?
Hell, no!
That guy thinks he's hot stuff...
Gon feels the same way!
I know! I know that...
But there isn't any other choice!
You're contradicting yourself,
but I understand how you feel!
Yield this fight, Gon!
It's suicide!
Honestly, the chairman's nasty
streak is in a class all its own.
What do you mean?
The applicants who've made it this far
are unlikely to simply surrender.
True.
This goes beyond a "rather peculiar fight."
This system is just plain crazy.
That kid's in danger.
Hunter Vocabulary
Hanzo
It's been three hours.
There's nothing left for him to vomit.
Get up.
Enough, already...
I'm gonna kill you!
I'll fight you in his place!
If you can't take it, leave.
It's only going to get worse.
What was that?!
No one may interfere in a one-on-one match.
And if you step in, Gon will be
the one disqualified!
It's okay...
Leorio.
This is...
nothing...
I-I can still fight...
I'm going to break your arm.
I'm not joking around,
so give up.
Surrender.
Never!
He really broke his arm.
There you go.
You can't use your left arm anymore.
Kurapika, don't try to stop me.
If that bastard does anything else to Gon...
Sorry, Gon, but I can't stop myself.
Me?
Stop you?
Don't worry.
There is no chance of that happening.
I'm sure you're in too much pain to listen,
but hear me out.
I am descended from the shinobi,
a clan of covert agents.
From the day I was born, I was forced
to endure harsh training in order
to master the art of ninpo.
For eighteen years,
I have trained my body and
technique, without rest.
By the time I was your age,
I had already killed a man.
Heh, that's nothing to brag about.
At this point in time,
you cannot defeat me in combat.
I'm trying to be nice.
Admit defeatâ€”
Ow...
Damn it!
My head's cleared a bit, after all the
pain and that long explanation.
Yes!
Gon, go!
Kick him while he's down!
If you're eighteen, you're only
six years older than I am.
Besides, this isn't a battle
to see who's stronger.
It's to see who's willing to surrender first.
I let you kick me on purpose.
Liar!
You don't understand...
This isn't a warning.
It's an ultimatum.
Was it too hard for you to understand?
Then I'll make it easier for you.
I'll cut off your legs,
so that they can't be reattached.
A permanent injury should
help to wake you up.
But first, I'll ask you once more.
Surrender.
I won't accept that!
I don't want my legs cut off,
but I don't want to surrender.
So let's find a different way to fight!
Hey... Do you understand
your own situation?!
Excuse me.
You don't get to make demands!
Are you trying to insult me?!
I'm seriously gonna cut off your legs!
But I still will not surrender.
Besides, if you do that,
I'll bleed to death.
He'll be disqualified if that happens, right?
Oh, yes.
See?
Neither of us wants that to happen.
So let's think of a better way.
I think he's okay now.
Gon's taken control.
He's so self-centered...
But he's succeeded in convincing
Hanzo and the rest of us.
Honestly...
What is this?
The situation hasn't changed.
Gon hasn't gotten stronger than his opponent.
His arm is still broken!
So why is the brutal
atmosphere from before
suddenly so much lighter?
You really don't get it...
If you die, you'll never get another chance.
If I kill you here,
I need only try again next year.
We are not on equal footing!
He's right, Gon.
You can try all you want
to talk your way out of this,
but he's far stronger than you.
That isn't something you can
neutralize on the spot.
It all comes down to power.
Why won't you concede?
It's easy to do.
You can try again next year.
You value your pride more
than your own life?!
You're really willing to die for your pride?!
I'm going to find my dad.
Your dad?
My dad is a Hunter.
So I'm going to become a Hunter
and find him!
I believe that I'll find him one day...
But I have a feeling that if I give up now,
I'll never find him!
So I won't surrender.
If you don't yield, you'll die...
He defies reason.
I give up. You win.
I can't kill you.
But I can't think of a way
to make you surrender.
I'll take this loss and take my
chances in the next battle!
I can't accept that.
That's not fair!
We both have to think of
a way to settle this fight!
Heh, I knew you would say that.
You fool!
There's no point, because you'll
never surrender!
But I don't want to win like this!
What am I supposed to do?
We can work together to figure it out!
In other words, I've already
given up on this match,
but you want me to try to win again,
while helping to determine a way to
make you feel good about your victory!
Is that right?
Uh-huh!
You moron!
Hey, ref.
I lose. Let's move on to the next match.
Understood.
But I want to tell the executive
committee something first.
When he wakes up,
he'll probably refuse his passing judgment.
Because he's a stubborn boy,
as we've seen.
Only one person will fail this round, right?
If Gon fails, wouldn't that make the
rest of our fights meaningless?
Gon's victory has been assured,
following Hanzo's concession.
The Final Phase, to determine
the single failing applicant,
has only just begun.
Next time: Baffling x Turn Of x Events!
They got Gon, too!
﻿Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
The word "unknown" holds magic.
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.
They are known...
...as Hunters!
Baffling x Turn Of x Events
You're awake?
Where am I?
A waiting room, next to the
arena for the Final Phase.
Upsie-daisy...
Right. I was in the middle
of the Hunter Exam.
Your arm will heal quickly.
The break was very clean.
In fact, once it heals, the bone
will be stronger than before.
In any case,
congratulations on passing the exam.
Satotz-san, I...
You can't.
Just as someone who has failed
the exam can no longer pass,
someone who has passed
the exam can no longer fail.
The rest is up to you.
If you feel you are unqualified to be a pro,
you are free to destroy or
put away your license.
You can even sell it,
since no one else will be able to use it.
However,
a person who has passed the exam will
not be allowed to take it again.
Professional Hunters are treated well,
largely due to our predecessors' efforts.
Hence, there are many applicants
who harbor ill intentions.
If it weren't for them,
we would accept every person who applied.
Most professional Hunters consider
this card more valuable than their own lives,
yet no more than a worthless scrap
of paper at the same time.
The important thing
is what you accomplish once
you become a Hunter.
What I accomplish...
Gon-kun,
you can decide for yourself when
you're ready to use this card.
I have faith in your judgment.
Okay.
A lot of people helped me reach this point.
I'll use this once I've returned the favor.
Then allow me to congratulate you.
Thank you, Satotz-san.
What about the other applicants?
The exam is still going on, right?
No, the exam is over.
Really?
Yes, you slept for nearly an entire day.
Really?
The others who passed are currently
completing a brief orientation.
You will undergo the orientation later.
Who failed?
It was
Killua.
Why did Killua fail?
First, let me fill you in on what transpired
after you were knocked out.
That will help you understand
what occurred.
After you fell unconscious...
When he wakes up, he'll probably
refuse his license.
That sounds like something Gon would do.
Only one person will fail this round, right?
If Gon fails, wouldn't that make the
rest of our fights meaningless?
Don't worry. Gon has passed.
Nothing he says can change that.
If Gon were to throw a fit and kill me,
we still wouldn't be able
to revoke his license.
Very well.
Why did you let him win?
Let him win?
I'm sure you knew how to make Gon
surrender without killing him.
Given your skills.
When I torture someone,
I expect that person to hate me
for the rest of their life.
It's more effective and less stressful.
When someone is in pain,
their eyes show a gleam of hostility toward
the one responsible for that pain.
Even with extensive training,
it is difficult to suppress
that gleam of hate and rage.
But there was no gleam in Gon's eyes.
Can you believe it?
I had just broken his arm.
But his eyes had already
forgotten about that.
I guess you could say that he won me over.
If you need a reason, there you go.
Gon-kun, you were able to
win over your opponent.
Hanzo said so himself.
After that, the second match began.
The second match is Kurapika versus Hisoka.
Begin!
After the two of them fought for a while...
Wha—
I lose.
Huh?
And Kurapika won.
What did Hisoka say?
I don't know,
but Hisoka voluntarily conceded.
The third match pit Hanzo against Pokkle.
Pokkle found himself in much
the same position as you,
but he admitted defeat immediately.
Sorry, but I won't go easy on you.
That sealed the deal.
The fourth match was between
Hisoka and Bodoro.
The match was extremely one-sided,
but Bodoro refused to give up.
However, while Bodoro
was lying on the floor,
Hisoka whispered something in his ear.
And Bodoro surrendered.
The fifth match featured Killua and Pokkle,
but as soon as the fight began,
Killua walked away.
Confidently, he declared...
Sorry, but I'm not interested in fighting you.
He must have felt that he
could win his next match.
However,
Leorio requested that the sixth match
be postponed while Bodoro
recovered from his injuries.
So Killua and Gittarackur fought first.
Begin!
That was when Killua made a fatal mistake.
It's been too long, Kil.
Brother...
Hunter Vocabulary
Illumi
Huh? Gittarackur is Killua's brother?
Yes, his name is Illumi.
Hey.
Killua's brother?
He used those needles to change
the shape of his face?!
I heard that you cut up Mom and Milluki.
I guess.
Mom was crying.
Anyone would cry if their
son did that to them.
Tears of joy.
She was so happy to see that you'd grown up.
But she was worried about you leaving home,
so she asked me to check up on you.
What a coincidence.
I didn't know you wanted to be a Hunter.
I'm trying to get a license for my next job.
I don't really want to be a Hunter.
I just felt like taking the exam.
I see...
That's a relief.
Then I have some advice for you.
You're not cut out to be a Hunter.
You were born to be...
a killer.
Is that really what he said?
Killua mentioned his family before,
but they sound crazy...
He wasn't finished yet.
You're a puppet of darkness, without passion.
You don't want anything or wish for anything.
As one who lives in the shadows,
you can only feel pleasure
when people die.
That's how Dad and I raised you.
What would you accomplish
by becoming a Hunter?
True,
I don't desire to become a Hunter.
But...
I do have something I want...
You don't.
I do!
There's something I really want!
Tell me what it is that you want.
What's wrong?
There's nothing you really want, is there?
That's not it!
I want to become friends with Gon...
I'm sick of killing people...
I want to become friends with Gon,
and to live a normal life...
That's impossible.
You'll never be able to make friends.
Your only concern when you meet someone
is whether you should kill them.
That's how you were trained.
You just don't know how to classify Gon
because he's too dazzling for your eyes.
You don't actually want to
become friends with him.
You're wrong...
If you stay with him,
you'll end up wanting to kill him one day.
You'll get the urge to see if
you can kill him or not.
Because you have the soul of a killer.
As we mentioned before...
Yeah, I know!
Killua!
I don't give a damn if he's your brother.
He's a worthless piece of crap!
Don't listen to him!
Just beat the crap out of
him like usual and win!
You want to become friends with Gon?
Are you daft?
You already are friends!
I'm sure that's how Gon feels!
Really?
Hell, yeah, idiot!
Really... That's no good.
He considers Kil a friend.
Okay, I'll kill Gon.
A killer doesn't need any friends.
They'll only slow you down.
Where is he?
P-Please wait!
The match is still...
Where is he?
The waiting room over there...
Thank you.
This won't do.
I need a Hunter license to do my job...
But if I kill them, I'll fail,
and Kil will pass automatically.
Oh, darn. The same thing
will happen if I kill Gon.
I know!
I'll pass the exam before killing Gon.
Bastard...
If I wait until after passing the exam,
I can kill everyone here and
still keep my license, right?
Yes, according to the rules.
Did you hear that, Kil?
You have to beat me if
you want to save Gon.
Will you fight me for your friend's sake?
You can't do it.
Because you're more worried
about whether or not you can defeat me.
And you already have your answer:
"I'm not strong enough to beat my brother."
"Never fight an enemy you can't beat."
I drilled that into you...
Don't move!
If you move an inch, I'll assume
that the fight has begun.
And if our bodies make contact,
that will also mean the fight has begun.
There's only one way to stop me.
You know what that is.
But don't forget...
If you don't fight me, your dear Gon will die.
Take him out, Killua!
We won't let him kill you or Gon!
We'll stop him, whatever it takes!
Let him have it!
I surrender.
I lose...
Oh, that's good!
Then the battle's over.
I lied, Kil.
I was lying about killing Gon.
That was just a little test.
But now I have my answer.
You don't have the right to make friends.
Nor do you need friends.
You should just listen to Dad and me,
and do your job as you always have.
When the time comes,
I'll tell you to take the Hunter Exam.
You don't need a license yet.
After that, he was reduced
to a shell of himself.
Leorio and Kurapika tried to help,
but he wouldn't respond.
The sixth match was between
Leorio and Bodoro.
Bodoro had recovered,
but when the match began...
Begin!
It was over in a second.
Killua had killed Bodoro.
The committee disqualified him.
Gon-kun!
Where is everyone?
You need more rest, Gon-kun...
Gon.
Apologize to Killua!
Gon was angry.
Illumi had trampled on
his brother's desire to become
friends with Gon,
abandoning Killua to despair.
And Gon was angry.
Next time: Some x Brother x Trouble!
Do Leorio and I look alike?
Get out of here...
﻿Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
The word "unknown" holds magic.
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.
They are known...
...as Hunters!
Gon-kun!
Where is everyone?
You need more rest, Gon-kun...
Some x Brother x Trouble
After Gon learned why Killua
had been disqualified,
he was furious with Gittarackur...
Rather, Killua's brother, Illumi.
Apologize to Killua!
Apologize? For what?
You don't know what you did wrong?
Nope.
You don't have the right to be his brother.
Must I earn the right to be his brother?
He doesn't need to earn the
right to be my friend!
This boy is...
Don't bother apologizing.
Just take me to see Killua.
What will you do then?
That should be obvious...
I'm gonna rescue Killua!
You make it sound as
though I kidnapped him...
He walked away on his own.
But it wasn't by choice.
He was being manipulated by you people.
It's the same thing as kidnapping him!
We happened to be discussing
this very subject, Gon.
Kurapika and Leorio have both
lodged complaints.
The committee has been discussing
the fairness of Killua's disqualification.
Killua had been behaving
in a strange manner during and
since his battle with the man
who called himself Gittarackur!
I believe that he was hypnotized
into committing murder.
Under normal circumstances,
it would be impossible to use
hypnosis to induce a person to kill.
However, as Killua was raised
in a family of assassins,
murder was a part of his daily life,
so it's natural that he would lack
the ethical restraint of most!
I want to mention
that the attack happened during the
match between Bodoro and me.
It's possible that he was trying to help me.
Given that, the one who should be disqualified
is me.
In any case,
Killua was not in control of his own actions.
Thus, he should not have been disqualified!
That is mere speculation.
There is no proof.
There were no clear signs of manipulation.
In fact, I would question
the claim that he was hypnotized.
I agree that the incident occurred after
the battle between Leorio
and Bodoro had begun.
At that point, both fighters
were evenly matched.
Bodoro had more experience.
But in terms of raw combat ability,
Leorio was the stronger.
There was no need for Killua to interfere.
There was some other funny
business happening.
Like when you fought Hisoka.
Back then,
what did he say to you?
Neither of you seemed particularly tired.
But Hisoka whispered something in your ear,
right before conceding.
That's pretty strange.
I'd understand surrendering after your
opponent whispers something to you,
as happened with Hanzo and me,
or Bodoro and Hisoka.
Because we were under
considerable pressure.
But in your case, the exact opposite happened.
I have to wonder if you struck
some sort of bargain.
If you're going to question
anything that seems odd,
your own victory was quite odd, indeed.
If you have nothing to hide,
you should tell us what he said.
Right now.
I have no obligation to tell you.
Maybe not, but I believe you owe it to us.
Not really.
If you consider my victory to be odd,
a victory by default would be equally odd.
What?!
None of that matters...
Come on...
I want to get this lecture
over with so I can leave.
Hey, now...
None of that matters!
It's pointless to argue over whether
someone should have passed.
If you aren't happy about passing,
keep working until you're satisfied.
If Killua retakes the Hunter Exam,
he'll definitely pass!
It's unfortunate that he failed this time,
but it is what it is.
What does matter...
If you've been forcing Killua to kill,
against his will, all this time,
I'll make you pay!
Make me pay?
What, exactly, will you do?
I won't do anything.
Only, once I rescue Killua,
I'll never let you see him again!
Ahem.
Is everyone finished?
Gon is absolutely correct.
You must decide for yourselves
if you were worthy of passing.
You may complain about
the results all you like,
but we will not be changing our minds.
Killua has been disqualified.
And the rest of you have passed the exam.
Okay, then I shall continue the orientation.
The cards I've passed out
are your Hunter Licenses.
This card allows you
to enter 90% of the countries
that limit immigration,
as well as 75% of the restricted
areas in the world.
Crazy...
This card also provides free access
to 95% of public facilities,
and a line of credit that rivals
large corporations.
If you sell the card, you'll have enough
money to last seven lifetimes.
And if you keep it, you'll still
be living in comfort.
So take extra care that your
license isn't lost or stolen.
You won't receive a replacement.
According to our estimates,
one in five Hunters
lose their card within a year of receiving it.
As a Hunter, your first challenge
is to protect your card.
The rest is up to you.
Rise above challenges,
believe in your own strength,
and fulfill your dreams.
Then,
we now declare the seven members
here to be new Hunters!
Hunter Vocabulary
License
Gittarackur...
Tell me where Killua is.
Are you really going to take him away?
I think that's a bad idea.
I don't care what you think!
Killua is my friend.
I'm taking him with me.
Do they feel the same way?
You bet.
Fine.
I doubt you'll be able to
make it there anyway.
Killua went home.
Home?
Kukuroo Mountain.
Our family lives at the very top.
Kukuroo Mountain?
Got it. Thanks.
Is it really okay
for an assassin to give away
his base of operations?
Sure, it isn't a secret or anything.
The locals all know where we live.
Well, I'm sure they'll see the
light once they arrive.
We live in completely different worlds...
Oh, this?
Yep, it's broken.
He has incredible potential.
I can understand why you want
to see him grow up.
Didn't I tell you?
But that makes him all the more dangerous.
This would be the best chance to...
Gon is my prey.
Touch him, and you'll suffer
the consequences.
I know.
I've only known you for a short while,
but I know your tastes.
So, Hisoka.
What are you going to do now?
Wait patiently.
For the fruit to ripen...
Kukuroo Mountain?
Never heard of it before.
Kurapika, do you know where it is?
Hey, Kurapika!
Huh?
Oh, what is it?
The mountain!
He said something about Kukuroo Mountain.
Do you know where it might be?
No, I don't...
We can look it up online.
Yo!
Oh, Hanzo-san!
I'm going back to my country.
It was a short, yet seemingly long
acquaintance, but I had fun.
So did I.
If you ever visit my country, let me know.
I can show you the best tourist spots!
See ya!
Bye!
Cloud-Hidden Ninja
Hanzo
A shinobi who tries to leave an impression...
Hey.
Sorry about getting so excited back there.
No, I also lost control.
Forgive me.
No, I only got mad because you were right.
I was using you to take out my
frustration for winning by default.
But I'm over that now.
Since I passed, I'm going to make the best of it!
The question is what to do next.
Yes, you're right.
I'm going to travel the world,
gathering information
and discovering new species,
as an Exotic Game Hunter.
An Exotic Game Hunter...
Hey, what's that?
Oh, this?
You can use this to obtain
all kinds of information.
Is there anything you'd like to know?
I can look it up on the spot.
Oh...
Can you look up a Hunter named Ging?
Ging Freecss.
Sure, hold on...
Satotz?
Hey, who is this Ging guy?
Huh?
All information related to him is behind
a tight security system that
requires a bunch of different accesses.
He has some serious influence,
even at the national level.
Huh? Really?
Forget it, then...
Looks like your dad is someone really special.
Okay, let me know if anything comes up.
This is my e-mail address.
Bye.
Bye!
We should have asked him to
look up Kukuroo Mountain.
That's right.
It's okay.
As Chairman Netero was saying,
we are all Hunters now.
It's a bad idea to let other Hunters
know what you're doing.
We can look it up ourselves.
Gon-kun.
Satotz-san!
Gon-kun, you forgot this.
Oh, right...
Thanks!
And do you have a moment?
We'll be waiting in the lobby.
Okay!
Forgive me, but I couldn't help but
overhear your conversation.
I happen to specialize in the
discovery, restoration,
and preservation of ancient ruins.
When I first began,
I was only focused on the glory
derived from new discoveries.
But after watching a certain Hunter at work,
I came to feel ashamed.
That Hunter would discover ruins,
spend his own money to
completely restore them,
and take steps to preserve the
ruins for future generations,
thus ensuring that ordinary people
would have a chance to see them.
I was more impressed by
his dedication to his job
than by the beauty of the ruins.
The work he did to preserve those ruins
has been documented in manuals
used around the world.
And this Hunter, Gon-kun,
was Ging Freecss, the man
you were asking about.
I wished to meet him,
so I did some investigating.
However, quite frankly, he is an enigma.
I wasn't able to learn anything about him...
Really? Figures.
My goal is to become a Hunter like him.
My dream is to thank him in person one day.
Uh-huh.
That's all I had to say.
Sorry for interrupting you.
It's okay. Thanks for everything, Satotz-san.
Bye!
Oh...
Gon-kun.
Hmm?
Oh, never mind...
Take care of yourself.
Yeah. You, too.
Bye!
First, let's look up Kukuroo Mountain.
Yeah.
Kukuroo Mountain...
There it is.
"Kukuroo Mountain.
A 3,722 meter-high mountain,
in the Dentora region of
the Republic of Padokea."
The Republic of Padokea?
Never heard of it.
Where is it?
Hold on.
I'll bring up a map.
This is the Republic of Padokea.
It should be fine.
It appears to be a stable country.
It allows ordinary tourists.
That's where we'll find Killua?
By airship, it will take three days to reach...
When do we leave?
Today! Right now!
Yeah, no objection from me!
Understood. Then, I'll order tickets.
What's going on?
We've been stuck in one place forever.
This won't do.
We'll be late for our flight.
Pops! Do something!
I'm afraid I can't help this traffic.
And this is the only road.
In that case...
Yahoo!
Hey, Gon!
Do you realize how far away the airport is?
I want to rescue Killua as soon
as humanly possible!
Fine, you win.
This reminds me of the Hunter Exam.
That's right.
This is nothing compared
to the Hunter Exam.
Yeah...
You got that right.
Okay...
Race you to the airport!
Ready...
Go!
Gon and his friends set off for
the Republic of Padokea.
Their destination is Kukuroo Mountain,
where Killua's home is located.
Satotz.
Menchi. Buhara.
Hey, Satotz...
That was a close call.
You were watching?
That boy is a mystery...
I find myself wanting to help him.
I almost let the cat out of the bag.
About how the real Hunter Exam
hasn't ended yet.
Next time: A x Dangerous x Watchdog!
Fetch, doggie!
That's it...
Roll over, doggie!
Oh, yeah!
﻿This country allows ordinary tourists.
That's where we'll find Killua?
By airship, it will take three days to reach...
When do we leave?
Today! Right now!
Yeah, no objection from me!
Understood. Then, I'll order tickets.
I'm from a family of assassins.
So they're all assassins.
And the family has
really high hopes for me...
But I can't stand it.
Who wants to have their life
planned out for them?
Killua...
What's with the long face, Gon?
We'll be in the Republic of
Padokea by morning.
You'll see Killua soon enough.
Yep!
We'll definitely take Killua back with us!
A x Dangerous x Watchdog
Gon, Leorio, and Kurapika have arrived
in the Dentora region
of the Republic of Padokea, where Killua lives.
There it is.
The base for this family of
assassins is on that mountain?
It sure looks creepy...
Yes.
Once we reach our destination,
we should start gathering information.
Okay.
Kukuroo Mountain?
In that case, you should take the
scenic mountain bus tour over there.
The tour only runs once a day,
but you'll have a guide
to show you around.
Okay...
Thank you for taking the
Lamentation Tour today.
We will be visiting Kukuroo Mountain,
home to the famous Zoldyck
family of assassins.
Look.
They obviously aren't tourists.
Yes...
Everyone?
Please look to your right.
That is Kukuroo Mountain,
where the Zoldyck family lives.
A forest surrounds the 3,722-meter mountain,
and the Zoldyck estate is
somewhere on that mountain.
But no one has ever actually seen it.
The Zoldyck family includes ten members:
a great-grandfather, grandfather,
grandmother, father, mother,
and then, there are five children.
All of them are assassins!
Then, let us approach the mountain.
That's really something.
This is the front gate of the Zoldyck estate.
Also known as the Door to Hades
because no one who's entered
has ever returned alive.
To enter, you must pass through the door
beside the security checkpoint.
But the area beyond the gate
is private property,
so we can't proceed.
Hold on!
This is the front gate?
The mountain's all the way over there!
Correct...
The Zoldycks own Kukuroo Mountain,
as well as the surrounding land.
This whole area is their backyard?
Hey, guide...
Yes?
What do we have to do to get inside?
Little boy, were you listening
to my explanation?
Uh-huh.
But...
If you go inside, you'll never get out alive!
Assassins live inside.
It's all a sham.
Huh?
A family of assassins that no one's ever seen.
Just a photo of their faces is
worth a hundred million.
Seriously?!
Damn!
I should have taken a picture of Killua!
It's just another case of rampant rumors
masking a mundane truth.
Open the gate!
I-I cannot do that.
The master would not be pleased.
Don't worry.
We're going to kill your master.
Ouch...
Are you okay?
Yes, I'm fine.
Man... Now Mike's going to end up
eating between meals again.
Huh?
Please...
He's only supposed to eat at assigned times.
Mike!
Don't blame me if you get fat!
What was that?
Hey, boys!
What are you doing?
Get on the bus!
You can leave.
We're staying here.
Huh?
I see.
So you're young Killua's friends.
I'm happy to hear that.
I've worked here for twenty years,
but this is the first time
any friends have come to visit.
Since I work here, I shouldn't say this,
but the place is rather lonely.
No one ever visits.
Though we do see a lot of those...
Well, a family of assassins is pretty unusual.
So I suppose it's the price they have to pay.
Anyway, I'm glad you're here.
Thank you.
Don't mention it.
However...
I cannot let you inside.
Didn't you see the large arm of the creature?
Its name is Mike.
It serves as the Zoldyck family watchdog.
It only obeys family,
and will attack anyone else.
The beast still follows the order
its master gave it ten years ago...
To kill every single intruder.
But technically, he isn't following the order.
Because he keeps eating them...
Anyway, I can't let you inside.
I wouldn't want to reduce young
Killua's friends to skeletons.
Sir, how is it that you're safe?
You go inside, correct?
If you never needed to enter,
you wouldn't have a key.
Quite perceptive of you.
But you're only half right.
I require no key to get inside.
This key is for intruders.
A key for intruders?
For some reason,
eighty to ninety percent of intruders
attempt to use the front gate.
If I don't open the gate for them,
they'll try to break it down.
Such troublemakers...
So we added a locked door to one side.
The intruders take the key
from the helpless guard,
and then Mike eats them.
A locked door...
That's it!
As you just realized, I'm not a guard.
I merely clean up after Mike.
And the actual gate isn't locked!
Exactly.
What?
Hunter Vocabulary
Lamentation Tours
I've tried pushing and pulling,
but it won't budge!
Are you sure it isn't locked?
You just aren't strong enough.
That's absurd!
I've been using all of my strength!
Just watch.
This gate's official name is the Testing Gate.
Anyone who cannot open this gate
is unqualified to enter the Zoldyck estate.
As you just saw, the door closes automatically,
so you'll want to run in, the second it opens.
You don't need to worry about Mike.
He has orders not to attack any who
enter through the Testing Gate.
Still, this is getting tougher as I age...
But they'll fire me if I can't open the gate,
so I need to keep in shape.
I should mention that each of gate
one's doors weighs two tons.
Two tons?
You're not supposed to be able to open that!
Wait, what did you say?
Gate one?
Yes, have a look.
There are seven gates.
When you go up a gate, the weight doubles.
Doubles?
The number of gates that open depends
on the amount of strength you use.
Incidentally, when young Killua returned,
he opened gates one through three.
Gate three?
That would be twelve tons!
Sixteen tons, Gon.
Do you understand now?
This is what's required just
to get in the door.
They live in a completely different world.
Hmm, I don't like it.
Mister, lend me the key.
I came here to see my friend,
not to be tested.
You can consider me an intruder.
So let me borrow the key.
I'll use the intruder's door.
Gon!
Hey...
It doesn't matter if you
won't loan me the key.
I'll just climb the wall, if that's what it takes.
Don't be stupid, Gon!
Didn't you see that monster?
Its arm was bigger than your entire body!
I won't accept this!
Why would you test your friends?
I'll never enter through that door.
You are absolutely right.
However, forcing your way
through is impossible.
Mike will kill you.
I agree.
We have plenty of time.
Let's figure out a way to
enter through gate one.
It's no use.
He's not gonna change his mind.
Indeed...
Unfortunately, I cannot lend you this key.
I will not feed young Killua's friends to Mike.
Well, please wait here for a minute.
Hello? This is Zebro.
Three of young Killua's
friends are here to see him.
Yes.
Yes, I'm sorry. Yes. Yes.
Yes, I understand. Yes.
I'm very sorry. I apologize for disturbing you.
Yep, I got in trouble.
You called the mansion?
No, I was speaking with the
Zoldyck family butler.
All communication with the mansion
must go through the butler.
It's very difficult to reach any
of the family members.
Could you call him again?
I'll talk to him this time.
Sure, I guess...
But you won't enjoy the experience.
Yes, this is the butler's office.
I'm Gon, one of Killua-kun's friends.
Is Killua-kun there?
Killua-sama has no friends.
Yes, this is the butler's office.
How could you possibly know that?!
Put Killua on the phone!
I believe you said that you were Gon-kun?
Yeah.
Let us pretend that Killua-sama happens
to have a friend named Gon.
There is no proof that you are Gon.
If you put Killua on the phone,
he'll recognize me!
By your voice?
That isn't a reliable test.
If you put Killua on the phone,
he'll recognize me!
That was a simple recording.
And there are many other ways
to mimic a person's voice.
Next, you'll claim that he'd
recognize you by sight.
There are only a few methods
by which you could perfectly mimic
someone's appearance.
But it still isn't impossible.
Additionally, it's possible that someone
forced you to approach Killua-sama
for sinister purposes.
As long as the threat exists,
I cannot let you meet with Killua-sama.
The Zoldyck family practices the
trade of assassination.
Naturally, it has made enemies.
As butlers, our duty is to guard our masters
from their enemies.
I apologize, but please leave.
Hey! Gon!
Gon!
He's really pissed now.
He's going to climb over the wall...
What?
Hey! Stop it, Gon!
It's okay. You two can wait here.
I'll go by myself.
I can't let you do that!
I'll be fine!
No, you won't!
Both of you should calm down!
I'm perfectly calm!
Come down here, Gon!
Don't be stupid.
Gon-kun, I'll give you the key.
You can go through the door.
Hold on, pops!
We can convince Gon to stop!
Really?
But he appears to be a stubborn boy.
To make amends,
I'll accompany you through the door.
Huh?
It's possible that Mike
may recognize me and decide not to attack.
Though I'm almost a hundred percent
certain that he'll kill us all.
You can't do that.
I don't want to cause you any trouble.
No, I'm coming with you.
The result will be the same if I stay behind.
If I send young Killua's friends to their deaths,
I'd never be able to face him again.
If you die,
I will also die.
I understand now.
I didn't stop to consider your situation.
Sorry.
He's a good boy.
He's willing to quell his own anger
for another person's sake.
He believes in his own strength,
as well as in his friends.
He has a strong heart.
It's likely that Mike
won't frighten him at all.
You must like animals, Gon-kun.
Yeah.
Just as I thought.
Did you grow up playing in the countryside?
Yep! How did you know?
Gon-kun, I'm going to open
the Testing Gate again.
I want you to see Mike for yourself.
Hey...
Is it really okay for us to come in?
Yes, you'll be safe because you
entered through the Testing Gate.
Mike! Come here!
Gon-kun, do you understand now?
This is a trained hunting dog.
It's nothing like the wild animals
you're accustomed to.
You must have expected to be able
to communicate with him.
Until you saw his eyes.
Mike is currently
memorizing the appearances and
scents of humans he's never seen.
There's nothing else on his mind.
He's like a machine.
Gon-kun, could you fight him?
No, I'm scared.
I don't want to fight him!
He's such an honest boy.
Well, how long will you be here?
Until we meet Killua!
We won't leave before then!
Then please come this way.
The Testing Gate...
And Mike...
Gon has seen that the Zoldyck family
lives in a completely different world.
However, Gon had promised himself...
No matter what difficulties awaited him,
he would find Killua in the end.
Next time: The x Guard's x Duty!
5 x 5 = 25.
So you know how to do math.
5 x 5 = 25!
﻿In the Dentora region
of the Republic of Padokea,
is a 3,722 meter-high dormant volcano
surrounded by forest,
Kukuroo Mountain.
The home of the famous Zoldyck
family of assassins is here.
Visitors come, every day,
hoping for a glimpse of the
mansion that no one has ever seen before.
It is a very popular tourist spot
in this nation.
Lamentation Tours
Well, how long will you be here?
Until we meet Killua!
We won't leave before then!
Then please come this way.
The x Guard's x Duty
Gon and his friends have confronted
the obstacles that they must overcome
in order to meet with Killua.
What awaits them at their destination?
Here are the servants' quarters.
It's getting late.
So you can stay here tonight.
Please come in.
Hey, I'm back!
Oh, you rarely bring guests.
This is Seaquant.
He works with me here.
Good evening.
If you managed to win over Zebro,
you must be special.
Well, make yourselves at home.
Though it won't be easy here.
You want to see young Killua?
That's a riot!
Sorry. But we're dead serious.
Then let me give you a warning:
Give up, and go home.
What was that?!
Zebro told you about the
Testing Gate, right?
That should give you an idea of
what this place is like.
We understand that it won't be easy.
But I'm not leaving.
Not until I see Killua!
When Killua was in trouble,
I wasn't there for him.
If I had been there,
I could have stopped Killua!
Killua is my close friend!
We understand.
Then why not do some training here?
Training?
Hey, Zebro...
Listen to me, Gon-kun.
You three are allowed to work together
to open the door.
With a little training, it should be possible.
How about it?
I don't like the idea of being tested...
But if there is no other way...
We'll just have to do it!
Yep!
Then I'll need you to put these on.
How is this so heavy...
It weighs fifty kilograms.
Please wear it at all times,
except while you sleep.
I'll make it heavier as you get used to it.
Please have some tea.
What the...?
The cups weigh twenty kilograms.
This teapot weighs forty kilograms.
All furniture and utensils in this house
weigh over twenty kilograms apiece.
I see... So this will serve as training.
It's useless.
They'll give up in two or three days.
What was that?
Seaquant, I believe that
your shift has already started.
Oh, that's right...
Sorry about that.
He isn't a bad person.
By the way, where's the bathroom?
Through the door over there.
I'm guessing that
the door is also...
Yes, it weighs five hundred kilograms.
Five hundred?
What?! Get out!
I can't hold it in!
Kalluto-chan, open the door.
Kil, have you learned your lesson yet?
It's no use, Mama.
He isn't even the least bit sorry.
We need to make him suffer more.
Milluki! Shut your mouth!
Kil, stop being so stubborn
and say that you're sorry.
Oh, right. That friend of yours...
Gon, was it?
He'd be better off just leaving,
but it sounds like he wants
to try the Testing Gate.
Gon is here...
Milluki! You're talking too much!
Listen to me, Kil...
You didn't even tell me?!
Don't yell at Mama!
I told you to shut your mouth!
I didn't think I needed to tell you, Kil...
Since it's impossible for him
to open the front gate.
He'll do it.
What?
Gon will open it.
Oh, that's nice.
But he'll still never make it here...
Gon will...
He'll do it.
He will definitely make it here.
Wait, Gon!
You just watch.
Huh? Why?
You need to let your arm heal first.
As long as Kurapika and I can open it,
it doesn't matter.
Let us handle this!
Okay.
Let's do this, Kurapika!
Yeah!
It's impossible...
No use... It won't budge an inch.
Damn!
But we just started our training.
If we work hard enough, we can do it!
I wish I could share your optimism.
This will never work.
You kids need to wake up.
In that case,
you should quit watching us
and do your job!
Gon is one of us.
And he wishes to see his friend.
It's only right that we should help him.
Okay, let's give it another shot!
Yeah!
Man, you can't just mindlessly push.
Match your timing.
You have to push both doors,
with all your strength, simultaneously.
Or the gate won't ever open.
Match our timing...
And push both doors with all our
strength simultaneously...
Okay!
One!
Two!
Three!
Leorio! Kurapika!
It moved.
Hunter Vocabulary
Testing Gate
What?
The Testing Gate?
And?
Oh, well...
I just wanted to let you know.
Very well.
He's always so cold.
Hey, why don't you try removing
those vests today?
Oh? Music to my ears!
Yeah!
Without them, we can
definitely open the gate now.
Let's do this, Kurapika!
Yeah!
One... Two...
Three!
Damn it...
It won't move any farther.
One last spurt, Leorio...
Got it!
Gon...
Why are you using your left arm?
It's okay.
My arm's healed now.
Healed?
Are you sure, Gon?
Yep!
Anyway, we have to push together, right?
Right, let's push!
Here we go!
One!
Two!
Three!
It's opening...
Ow...
It opened.
Yes!
We did it, Gon!
Uh-huh!
Follow the path, and head for the mountain.
The mansion should be somewhere up there.
I'm ashamed to admit
that even though I've worked
here for twenty years,
I've never been up the mountain.
Sorry that I couldn't be any help.
No, that isn't true.
You've both been a huge help.
Thank you for everything!
Goodbye!
Those kids are really something.
They might be able to
make it to the mansion.
Won't happen. They'll just
get themselves killed.
Speaking from your experience
three years ago?
We were wiped out by an apprentice butler.
That made it painfully clear
that I wasn't on their level.
So you decided to work here.
Sorry...
But the masters and servants
are all monsters.
Once you step into their territory...
The Testing Gate opened?
Yes, ma'am.
This is a critical time for Killua.
We cannot allow anyone near him!
Especially not those unnecessary friends...
Do you understand?
Yes, ma'am.
Leave.
You're trespassing on private property.
I cannot allow you to pass
without permission.
We called ahead.
And we came through the Testing Gate.
The butlers did not give you
permission to enter.
What do we need to do to get permission?
I said I was Killua's friend,
but they wouldn't put him on.
I wouldn't know.
Because no one has ever
received permission.
Then we'll have to trespass!
I suppose so.
In any case, this is where I draw the line.
If you take one step beyond this line,
I'll remove you by force.
Gon!
Damn it!
Leorio! Kurapika!
Don't interfere.
Let me handle this.
Ow...
We don't intend to fight you.
We just want to see Killua.
It doesn't matter what your motives are.
I'm simply following my orders.
You can try all you want.
I'll never let you pass.
I will pass...
I'm going to see Killua!
Welcome home,
Killua-sama.
Yeah.
I made...
a friend...
Stop it.
Stay away!
Cut it out!
Don't you realize how futile this is?!
Why don't you stop him?
Aren't you his friends?
What's the problem?
I'm just here to see my friend.
I'm just here to see Killua!
Why do I have to do this?!
Hey.
Huh?
I crossed the line.
Aren't you supposed to hit me?
You're different from Mike.
You may try to hide your feelings,
but you have a heart.
When I mentioned Killua,
your eyes softened for a moment.
Please...
Help Killua-sama—
Honestly...
What was that servant babbling about?
She made it sound like we're
being mean to Killua.
A worthless apprentice had
the nerve to insult us!
You must be Gon.
I heard about you from Illumi.
Killua knows that you're here.
I have a message for you from Kil...
"Thank you for coming.
I really appreciate it.
But I can't see you right now.
Sorry."
Gon and his friends have finally made it
inside the Zoldyck estate.
But now, they face their
greatest obstacle yet.
A sad message from Killua,
saying that he can't see them.
Next time: The x Zoldyck x Family!
What is Killua to you?
My big brother!

Gon, Kurapika, and Leorio have advanced
a little closer to the mansion.
Meanwhile...
I'm home.
Well, no one's around.
Welcome back.
How did work go?
Fine.
Does that mean you dispatched your target?
I'm sure you were watching me
from a distance.
Mom's waiting for you inside.
I don't want to see her.
Ah.
Did you need something?
I wanted to say hello.
Are you new here?
Yes.
While you were away,
I was hired as an apprentice butler.
My name is Canary.
Here. You can have this.
No, thank you.
But I appreciate the thought, Killua-sama.
Don't be so formal. Just call me Killua.
I cannot do that.
I am a servant.
And you are my employer.
Tsk... That's lame.
You were using the Shadow Step, right?
Shadow Step?
The technique where you move silently,
so you won't be noticed.
It's one of the first assassination
techniques we learn
in the Zoldyck family.
Is that so?
I must have learned it while
growing up in Meteor City.
Meteor City?
My hometown.
It's a city that has been erased from this world.
Huh, never heard of it.
You're allowed to dump anything in Meteor City.
That's why many members
of the mafia and the Phantom
Troupe come from there.
I'd like to visit some time.
When you visit, I can serve as your guide.
I'll teach you the Rhythm Echo.
Rhythm Echo?
It's a technique that utilizes the Shadow Step.
You move at a certain rhythm,
creating afterimages.
I see...
It appears we have intruders.
Many intruders.
Let Mike handle it.
The master has ordered that
Mike be restrained today.
They wish to test my abilities.
We'll split up and look for their mansion.
Leave.
Who are you?
There is no need for me to answer that question.
You are trespassing on private property.
I cannot allow you to pass without permission.
Can you stop us?
It's obvious that you stand no chance.
Well, if you don't resist, we'll spare your life.
If you take one step past this line,
I shall use force to remove you.
What was that?
You can stand back and watch, boss...
We'll take care of this.
Let's go!
Don't mock us!
Bitch!
Get her!
Do you wish to continue?
After all that, she hasn't
even broken a sweat...
Are you a member of the Zoldyck family?
Hardly.
I am but an apprentice butler.
With your abilities,
you're not even a match for the butlers,
let alone the Zoldyck family.
A futile effort...
I'm telling you that it's useless!
As a Hunter,
I cannot allow a little girl
like you to defeat me.
Prepare yourself!
What?
Die!
I-I'm sorry!
Please spare my life!
Zebro-san...
You noticed my presence?
Could you clean this up?
Sure, that's my job.
Plus, Mike is starving.
Huh?
H-Help!
You already knew the Rhythm Echo.
Yes... Forgive me.
You think you're stronger than I am.
Absolutely not.
Really?
So, I don't have anyone to play with.
Will you be my friend, Canary?
I apologize, Killua-sama.
Tsk. Lame...
Let's be friends!
Gon...
Hunter Vocabulary
Canary
Is she okay?
Yeah.
She's only unconscious.
Wake up!
Oh. Morning, Bro.
What time is it?
Don't be too arrogant, Kil!
What?
I feel really bad about stabbing you, Bro.
Sorry. It was the wrong thing to do, Bro.
You're lying!
You can tell?
Tsk!
Hello?
Oh, Mama?
Uh-huh.
Yep, I understand.
Kil,
your friends are near the butler's office.
How about it, Kil?
If I ask Mama, those three can become...
Milluki.
If you so much as touch them, I'll kill you.
Forgive me for not introducing myself.
I am Killua's mother.
This is Kalluto.
Why can't Killua come see us?
Because he's in solitary confinement.
Solitary confinement?
Kil stabbed me and his brother
before he ran away from home.
That is the story he told us.
Kil returned because he regretted his actions.
And he voluntarily entered
solitary confinement.
So we do not know when he will leave...
What? Father! What are you doing?!
Don't do anything hasty!
He's finally returned!
I'm coming in.
One Kill Per Day
That's enough, Mil.
But, Grandpa Zeno...
He isn't sorry at all.
I know that.
Kil, you can go.
Okay.
Man, that hurt.
Bro, I'm not sorry.
But I do feel bad.
So I let you slap me around.
What was that?
Kil, Silva wants to see you.
Dad?
Okay.
Damn it!
You always spoil Kil, Grandpa!
That's why he's such an uppity brat...
He's special.
Mil, what do you think of Kil's potential?
It's incredible, sure.
He's probably the most talented
Zoldyck in history?
Mama seems to think so.
I have to agree.
Considerable praise.
But he fails as an assassin
because he's so moody.
Moody?
A kid who wants to make friends
can't lead the Zoldyck family.
In the end, he's just a crybaby.
Mentally weak.
That is true...
Right? Take me.
I'll kill anyone I'm asked to.
Oh, that's right.
The bomb I'll use next time
is awesome, Grandpa!
It's super-compact.
I attached it to a female mosquito,
and it's triggered to explode when the
mosquito sucks the target's blood.
But the problem is getting the mosquito
to recognize the target...
Mil...
You're a bright boy,
but that foolish nature of yours doesn't help.
Oh, why must Father be this way?
Something has come up.
So I bid you farewell.
Please wait!
We'll be staying in town for a while.
Please let Killua know.
Very well. I shall tell him.
Goodbye.
Who are you?
Killua's friends.
Friends...
Kalluto-chan! What are you doing?
Come over here!
Yes, Mother.
I probably shouldn't say it,
but these people creep me out...
And I bet they were lying about Killua's
saying that he can't see us.
Gon, we can't go back yet.
How about we tail them?
Sure, but if we do that,
she'll take the blame.
Oh, right...
I will take you to the butler's office.
There is a phone that connects to the mansion.
If Zeno-sama is the one who answers...
Zeno-sama?
Killua-sama's grandfather.
Kil.
I heard that you've made some friends?
Yeah.
What sort of people are they?
What sort of...?
They're people I enjoy being with.
I see.
How was the Exam?
It was easy.
Kil, come over here.
Huh?
I want you to tell me more.
What did you do during the Exam?
Who did you meet? How did you feel?
You can tell me anything...
Okay.
I can't believe this.
Father didn't even ask me first.
Oh, Kil seems to be having fun with Papa...
I won't forgive them!
And guess what Gon said next...
He didn't want his legs cut off,
but he didn't want to surrender, either!
He's so self-centered.
Sounds like an interesting boy.
And then his opponent
pointed a blade at Gon's forehead,
but Gon still...
Kil.
Huh?
Do you want to see your friends?
You don't need to hold back.
Tell me the truth.
Thinking back,
we've never had a father-son chat before.
I was raised by my parents to be an assassin.
And I raised you the same way.
You and I are different.
I didn't realize that until you left home.
You are my son.
But you are your own person.
Live as you please.
If you get tired, you can come home.
I'll ask you one more time.
Do you want to see your friends?
Uh-huh.
I understand.
You're free now.
But...
Promise me one thing.
Never betray your friends.
Understand?
I promise.
I'll never betray them.
Never.
Kil.
It's too late. Those three left.
Return to your cell.
No way. I'm leaving.
Kil!
Out of my way.
Oh, Kil...
Your eyes are so cold now...
What were you thinking?
Kil was finally home!
For now, we'll let him do what he wants.
No! What are you saying?
This is a critical juncture in the process
of determining if he's qualified
to lead the family!
So you understand what's at stake.
Then stop griping, and keep your mouth shut!
He'll come home one day.
Because he is my son.
Killua has been set free.
But Silva declares that Killua
will return as an assassin.
Meanwhile, Gon and his friends
head to the butler's office.
Will they be able to see Killua?
Next time: Can't See x If x You're Blind!

Can't See x If x You're Blind
After a discussion with the father he admires,
Killua leaves his home again,
despite his mother's objections.
Gon and his friends are led by Canary
to the butler's office,
to attempt to meet with Killua.
Aren't we there yet?
We still have a while to go.
How much walking do we have to do...
Honestly, I cannot believe this!
Kil was finally home!
But the men allowed him to leave again!
And Father is just as guilty!
He released Kil without permission!
Really,
this always happens!
They never ask me before they act.
Do you understand, Gotoh?
Yes, ma'am.
Th-This is a most critical time for Kil...
Why don't they understand?
He's the one child I shall not give up!
There it is.
That building?
But it's still pretty far away.
Say, Canary.
Won't you get in trouble
for bringing us here?
They already know what I'm doing.
So I am prepared to take the consequences.
If there's any trouble, I'll take responsibility.
No.
I'm merely serving as a guide
for Killua-sama's friends.
Killua-sama, we've been waiting for you.
Gotoh, where's Gon now?
You do know, right?
Canary is bringing Gon-sama here,
along with his two friends.
Really?
They should arrive shortly,
so please wait inside.
Okay.
Gotoh.
Yes, sir.
Let me know the second Gon gets here.
Yes, sir.
I shall notify you immediately.
Forgive me, Killua-sama.
Hey, we finally made it.
Welcome.
Please forgive the rude reception.
The lady of the house has
asked us to treat you
as official guests.
Is that better?
Thanks.
Then this is not the primary residence?
No, this place is for the butlers.
Well, please make yourselves at home.
I appreciate the hospitality,
but we've come to see Killua.
Can you take us to him at once?
That won't be necessary.
Killua-sama is on his way here.
Really?
Yes, so please wait a little longer.
That's great news, Gon!
Yeah!
Now, then...
To simply sit and wait would be dull.
How about a game, to pass the time?
A game?
Which hand holds the coin?
The left hand.
Correct.
So I'll move more quickly this time.
Well? Which hand?
Left again.
Marvelous.
Then I shall try harder this time.
Well? Which hand?
I'm not positive, but I'd guess the right.
You see...
I have known Killua-sama his entire life.
I dare say that I care for him
as though he were my own.
In all honesty,
I must despise you for trying
to take him away.
Well? Which hand?
Answer.
The left hand.
His lady mother could barely speak...
She must be heartbroken,
having to watch him leave.
I cannot forgive it.
By the time Killua-sama arrives,
a decision will be reached.
I shall test you in my own way.
You have no choice.
Canary!
This is her punishment for having
brought you here, against her orders.
I shall explain the rules.
If one of you answers incorrectly,
that person is out of the games.
Should you all be disqualified,
I shall tell Killua-sama that you left.
And that he will never see you again.
Killua is...
Silence!
Your lives hang by a thread.
Now, answer my question.
Which hand?
I couldn't see it...
Don't take too long.
You have three seconds to answer.
Hey...
After three seconds have passed,
slit her throat.
Okay.
Wait! Left hand!
I pick the right hand!
Me, too!
One disqualified.
This is futile.
I can't see anything!
Which hand?
I choose the right hand.
I pick the left.
It was in my left hand.
Only one remains now.
Here I go.
One second!
What is it?
If you're trying to buy time,
I'll kill one of your friends.
Leorio, lend me your knife.
Huh?
Don't worry.
I won't use it for anything stupid.
That's it...
He's bleeding himself, to reduce the swelling.
Man, how long do I have to wait?
Hey, Gotoh!
Anyone around?
What's going on?
Okay!
Now I can see.
Give me your best!
Which hand?
Left hand.
Not bad.
In that case...
Who now holds the coin?
Hunter Vocabulary
Waiting Time
The person right behind me.
Brilliant.
Gotoh, is Gon here yet?
Killua!
Oh! You're here, Gon!
Along with...
Kurapika?
I'm just an afterthought?
Liorio!
Leorio!
It's been a while.
I can't believe you came.
What happened?
Your face is a wreck!
Yours isn't any better!
Hey, Gotoh.
I told you to let me know
as soon as they arrived.
What were you doing?
Forgive me.
I had them participate in a little game.
A game?
It was nothing more than a poor joke.
I apologize for any aggravation.
Did you enjoy yourselves?
That was really good acting...
What? Did they try something?
No, they were entertaining us.
Really?
Well, whatever.
Anyway, let's go somewhere else.
Anywhere else, right now.
If we stay here, my mother
will give us an earful!
Yeah!
Hey, Gotoh.
Listen up.
I don't care what Mother says.
Don't follow me.
Understood. Please take care.
Gon, let's go.
Bye.
Gotoh-san.
Once Killua leaves, you'll be lonely, huh?
No.
We butlers feel no emotional attachment
to our employers.
You're lying.
Gon-kun...
Well? Which hand?
Isn't it your left hand?
What? No way!
Indeed. It was a deception.
In this world, there are many
things that are wrong.
Please be careful.
I am entrusting Killua-sama to you.
Bye, Canary!
Took you long enough, Gon!
Sorry about that.
Let's make ourselves scarce
before more trouble comes.
Yeah, he's used that trick on me before.
Once you know the secret,
it's so simple, it'll make you mad.
Huh? Really?
I'm assuming this was what he did.
Which hand?
It's your left hand, right?
Huh? How?
Hey, how did you do that?
Gotoh held two coins.
Huh? But he only had the one.
Anyway, he hid a coin in his right hand,
while flipping the other.
And then he let us see him grab
the coin using his left hand.
But before he asked us
which hand held the coin,
he raised both arms,
and he slipped the first coin into his sleeve.
That left the coin in his right hand.
You got it.
That really makes me mad.
Well, I'm fairly certain he only used
the trick on the final turn.
Gotoh hates cheating, even if it's just a game.
That's even worse!
What?
You're here on a tourist visa?
Uh-huh.
Didn't you pass the Hunter Exam?
You could've just used your Hunter License.
It lets you stay in other countries
for as long as you want.
That's what we said.
I already decided.
I'm not using the license until I've
finished what I need to do.
What do you have to do?
The tag
that Hisoka gave me!
I'll only take it back
when you're able to punch me
in the face, just like that.
Until then, I shall leave the tag with you.
I'll return it to Hisoka when
I punch him in the face!
Until I do that, I won't use my Hunter License.
I can't go back to Whale Island, either.
Hmm...
So, where's Hisoka?
Uh...
Thought so...
I know where he is, Gon.
Huh? Really?
How?
He told me.
So that's what he said...
No, this was after the orientation.
But it's still related, right?
I suppose so.
I've been itching to ask...
What did Hisoka say to you?
He told me...
I have some information for you
regarding the spider.
The Phantom Troupe?
I do not recall mentioning the
Phantom Troupe to Hisoka.
So either he overheard our conversation
during the first stage,
or he heard of it from another.
The spider is the Phantom Troupe's symbol,
so those familiar with the organization
refer to the Troupe as such.
I was interested in his information.
I see...
So that's why you swallowed your pride
and accepted Hisoka's surrender.
After the orientation, I asked him about it.
I shall await you in Yorknew City,
on September 1st.
September 1st?
Then you've still got over half a year.
What's going to happen in Yorknew City?
They'll hold the world's largest auction.
Correct.
From September 1st through September 10th,
there will be an auction
for unusual items, rare goods,
and national treasures from around the world.
The event attracts all manner of nasty folk
who come looking to satisfy their greed.
It's the biggest gathering of money in the world.
So the Troupe will be there?
They're a group of bandits.
They would not let this chance escape.
So on that day, Hisoka will be
somewhere in Yorknew City.
Okay. September 1st.
Got it. Thanks.
Then I shall depart now.
Huh?
We managed to see Killua again,
so I'm finished here.
I'll need money to participate in the auction.
So I shall search for a patron
to employ me as a Hunter.
Really...
I guess I should go home, then.
You, too?
I haven't given up my dream
of becoming a doctor.
If I'm accepted to medical school,
I can use this to pay the ridiculous fee.
I'll have to go back and start cramming.
Uh-huh, good luck.
Until we meet again.
Yes, that will be...
September 1st, in Yorknew City.
See ya.
Bye-bye!
It's just the two of us now.
Hey, what do you want to do?
You have to ask? We train, obviously.
Huh? Train for what?
Shouldn't we have some fun?
Do you remember what you just said?
Think you can punch Hisoka in
the face without training?
You couldn't land a punch
in ten years, let alone six months!
Okay.
Here, I'll make it easy to understand.
This is Hisoka. This is Hanzo.
Uh-huh...
If this is the gap between Hisoka
and Hanzo, in terms of strength,
the gap between Hisoka and you
is this far!
And I'm being generous.
Now I'm mad...
Then where are you?
Me?
Well, probably around here.
Yep... I'm so humble.
Oh, Hanzo is stronger?
What is it?
You really are amazing!
Cut that out... It's embarrassing.
I don't know how to tell the
difference in strength
between my opponent and myself.
Stupid. It doesn't matter.
I'm only estimating.
You probably have a general idea.
Once you have enough experience,
your guess will become more accurate.
Besides, the stronger someone is,
the better they are at hiding that strength.
So you shouldn't rely on this method.
Oh...
Well, in any case, Hisoka is strong.
Yeah.
You won't land a blow on him in six
months through normal means.
Gon, do you have any money?
Actually, I'm running out.
I don't have much, either.
But there's somewhere we can train and
earn money at the same time.
Train and earn money?
The Heavens Arena.
Heavens Arena...
Yeah, I'll explain later.
We should get moving.
Okay!
After bidding farewell to Kurapika and Leorio,
with promises to meet again in Yorknew City,
Gon and Killua now head to a new stage,
the Heavens Arena.
Next time: Then x And x After!
I like sweet and spicy.
I like salty and spicy.
Spicy is good for you!
﻿Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
The word "unknown" holds magic.
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.
They are known...
...as Hunters!
Then x And x After
"Dear Mito-san and Grandma,
how are you doing?
I'm doing great, as always.
So, I actually passed the Hunter Exam.
While I managed to pass the exam,
I'm not too happy about it.
That's because of what happened
during the Final Phase."
You really don't get it...
If you die, you'll never get another chance.
If I kill you here,
I need only try again next year.
We are not on equal footing!
You value your pride more
than your own life?!
You're really willing to die for your pride?!
I'm going to find my dad.
My dad is a Hunter.
So I'm going to become a Hunter
and find him!
I believe that I'll find him one day...
But I have a feeling that if I give up now,
I'll never find him!
So I won't surrender.
If you don't yield, you'll die...
He defies reason.
I give up. You win.
That's not fair!
We both have to think of
a way to settle this fight!
You fool!
"He knocked me out.
So Satotz-san had to tell me
what had happened next."
Begin!
It's been too long, Kil.
Brother...
You're not cut out to be a Hunter.
You were born to be...
a killer.
What would you accomplish
by becoming a Hunter?
True,
I don't desire to become a Hunter.
But...
I do have something I want...
You don't.
I do!
There's something I really want!
Tell me what it is that you want.
I want to become friends with Gon...
I'm sick of killing people...
I want to become friends with Gon,
and to live a normal life...
That's impossible.
You'll never be able to make friends.
Because you have the soul of a killer.
If you move an inch, I'll assume
that the fight has begun.
And if our bodies make contact,
that will also mean the fight has begun.
If you don't fight me,
your dear Gon will die.
I surrender.
I lose...
"Killua gave in to his despair after that."
Apologize to Killua!
Apologize? For what?
You don't know what you did wrong?
Don't bother apologizing.
Just take me to see Killua.
What will you do then?
That should be obvious...
I'm gonna rescue Killua!
"After that, Kurapika, Leorio, and I
went to Kukuroo Mountain,
where Killua lives."
This gate's official name is the Testing Gate.
Anyone who cannot open this gate
is unqualified to enter the Zoldyck estate.
Listen to me, Gon-kun.
You three are allowed to work together
to open the door.
With a little training, it should be possible.
Let's do this, Kurapika!
Right, let's push!
Here we go!
One!
Two!
Three!
Ow...
It opened.
Yes!
We did it, Gon!
Uh-huh!
Leave.
You're trespassing on private property.
I cannot allow you to pass
without permission.
If you take one step beyond this line,
I'll remove you by force.
What's the problem?
I'm just here to see my friend.
I'm just here to see Killua!
Why do I have to do this?!
You're different from Mike.
You may try to hide your feelings,
but you have a heart.
When I mentioned Killua,
your eyes softened for a moment.
Please...
Help Killua-sama—
You must be Gon.
I heard about you from Illumi.
Killua knows that you're here.
Why can't Killua come see us?
Because he's in solitary confinement.
Solitary confinement?
Kil returned because he regretted his actions.
And he voluntarily entered
solitary confinement.
I will take you
to the butler's office.
There is a phone that connects to the mansion.
If Zeno-sama is the one who answers...
Well? Which hand?
I have known Killua-sama his entire life.
I dare say that I care for him
as though he were my own.
In all honesty,
I must despise you for trying
to take him away.
If one of you answers incorrectly,
that person is out of the games.
Should you all be disqualified,
I shall tell Killua-sama that you left.
And that he will never see you again.
Here I go.
One second!
What is it?
If you're trying to buy time,
I'll kill one of your friends.
That's it...
He's bleeding himself, to reduce the swelling.
Okay!
Now I can see.
Give me your best!
Who now holds the coin?
The person right behind me.
Brilliant.
Gotoh, is Gon here yet?
Killua!
Oh! You're here, Gon!
Along with...
Kurapika?
I'm just an afterthought?
Liorio!
Leorio!
It's been a while.
I can't believe you came.
What happened?
Your face is a wreck!
Yours isn't any better!
"And just like that,
we managed to rescue Killua.
However, there is one more piece
of business I must take care of, Mito-san."
Hunter Vocabulary
Alphabet
"The business I still need to take care of
is left over from the exam's Fourth Phase."
I will need you to draw lots.
Lots?
For what?
To determine who will hunt
and who will be hunted.
Listen carefully!
Your target's ID tag is worth three points.
Your own ID is also worth three points.
All other ID tags are worth one point.
You need six points to advance
to the Final Phase.
So while on Zevil Island,
you must gather enough ID tags
to total six points.
That is the condition for clearing
the Hunter Exam's Fourth Phase.
What number did you draw?
Show each other our numbers
at the same time?
Okay!
Ready, and...
#44 is...
Seriously?
In a straight-up fight,
I wouldn't stand a chance.
But if I only need to steal his ID tag,
then I have a real shot.
Yeah.
I might actually have a chance.
That scares me a little...
But I think it's worth it.
Now!
I did it!
I figured it out!
I have to aim for my target as
he hunts his own prey!
There!
At this rate, Hisoka will spot him
in the next minute.
I have to figure out where
their paths will cross...
Over there!
I've gotta hurry.
Hisoka will attack,
as soon as he notices that guy.
This is my chance to steal his tag...
My last chance!
I have to conceal my presence, too.
Completely conceal my...
presence.
Here he comes!
Hisoka!
Damn... Bring it!
I did it...
I took Hisoka's tag!
Approximately, seven thousand.
Do you know what that
number represents?
The number of chances
I had to kill you.
It's also the number of times you swung
your fishing rod when you were training.
Next time, remember to
watch your own back.
So long.
Damn it...
You surprise me.
You hid your presence,
while waiting for your chance?
Waiting for me to attack another?
Did you teach yourself how
to conceal your presence?
Marvelous...
Like a wild animal.
And your timing was impeccable.
You concealed all traces of your attack
by timing it with my own attack.
A splendid job.
Wait...
Didn't you come to take back your tag?
No, I just came to commend you.
You owe me one now.
Feel free to pay me back when you want.
Goodbye.
I don't want to owe anyone...
You can have it back now.
I refuse.
Right now, I'm letting you live.
And I'll continue to keep you alive,
until you've grown enough
to be worth killing...
I'll only take it back
when you're able to punch me
in the face, just like that.
Until then, I shall leave the tag with you.
"It's the first time I've ever
felt that frustrated.
So I need to find a way to return the favor.
I can't return to Whale Island
until that's done.
That's why I'll be going to
Heavens Arena with Killua,
to train as a Hunter.
Please take care until I get back.
Gon Freecss."
I didn't expect him home anytime soon.
He really is your son...
Are you watching over him,
Ging?
Next time: Arrival x At The x Arena!
Off we go!
Gon Gon!
Again?
﻿Train and earn money?
The Heavens Arena.
Heavens Arena...
Yeah, I'll explain later.
We should get moving.
Okay!
Whoa.
Look, it's huge!
Yep.
That's Heavens Arena.
Two hundred and fifty-one stories.
Nine hundred, ninety-one meters tall.
The world's fourth tallest building.
So this is where we'll be training...
I used up all my money on the trip fare.
We'll have to make more here.
After we disembark, we'll start from zero.
Okay, got it.
Good... Let's go.
Yeah!
Arrival x At The x Arena
Gon and Killua
head to Heavens Arena,
seeking to get stronger.
Gon.
There's a really long line.
Everyone's going to Heavens Arena?
There aren't any conditions here,
like there were for the Hunter Exam.
You just have to defeat your opponent.
Oh...
The higher you go, the more
prize money you earn.
This is as good as it gets for those looking
to make a living with their fists.
Welcome to Heavens Arena.
Please fill out this form.
Killua Zoldyck-sama, you are #2054.
Gon Freecss-sama, you are #2055.
They'll call your number
on the first floor of the arena,
so make sure you remember it.
Then please go ahead.
Go!
Take him out!
It's been a while,
but the place hasn't changed.
Huh? You've been here before?
Yeah, when I was six.
My dad left me here without a penny.
He said I should reach floor 200
before coming home.
It took two years.
Two years...
Sure, he was only six, but it
really took Killua that long?
If you want to fight people of Hisoka's level,
you'll need to go higher.
Let's hurry.
Okay.
#1973.
#2055.
Please enter ring E.
#2055! That's me!
I'm getting nervous now.
Gon, you got through the
Testing Gate, right?
Huh?
In that case...
Look at that! It's a little boy!
Hey, kid!
This is your last chance to run!
This ain't a game!
One punch, and he'll fly out of the ring!
On the first floor, we appraise
each participant's level.
You are allowed three minutes
to demonstrate your prowess.
Then... Begin!
Sorry...
I'll end your suffering with one punch.
You got through the Testing Gate, right?
In that case, all you have
to do is push hard.
Just push
hard!
No way!
Yes!
That kid's incredible!
He's got some crazy power!
When did I become so strong?
#2055, proceed to floor 50.
All right!
Hey, here's another kid who's a beast!
Oh?
You've already been to the 200th floor?
And this was a strong performance.
Very well. You may go to the 180th floor...
Oh, I'll start from the 50th floor.
Huh?
I want to take it easy.
That's enough!
Yet another strong kid there!
You are permitted to
advance to the 50th floor.
Osu!
The first 200 floors of Heavens Arena
are divided into classes,
each comprised of ten floors.
So after someone defeats an
opponent in the 50s,
they advance to the 60s.
If they lose, then they'd
drop back to the 40s.
Oh, so that's how it works.
Plus...
I've heard that
after you pass the 100th floor,
you get your own room!
Oh, I forgot to introduce myself.
Osu! My name is Zushi!
What about you guys?
I'm Killua.
I'm Gon.
Nice to meet you.
We've arrived at the 50th floor.
I saw your fight earlier.
That was really amazing!
What are you talking about?
You made it up here with one match, too.
That's right.
No...
I still have a long way to go.
By the way, which martial arts
discipline do you practice?
I study the Shingen-ryu fighting technique.
School? We don't have one, right?
No...
What?
You're that strong with no training?
I'm kind of shocked...
I still have so far to go!
Zushi.
You did well.
Master!
You adhered to my teachings.
Osu! I am honored!
Master, your shirt is untucked again.
Oh, sorry about that...
Who are they?
Oh, these are Killua-san and Gon-san.
Nice to meet you. I'm Wing.
Osu!
I didn't expect to meet other children.
Why are you here?
Uh...
Well, we want to become stronger.
But we're also broke,
so we're making money simultaneously.
Killua's a veteran here.
Oh?
If you're up here, you must be fairly skilled,
but you should pay strict attention
to your opponent's body,
as well as your own.
Osu!
Killua-sama, Gon-sama, and Zushi-sama?
Please hand me your tickets.
Here is your prize money.
One hundred, fifty-two jenny...
On the 1st floor, win or lose,
your reward covers a canned drink.
But beyond that,
a loss gets you nothing.
A win over an opponent in the 50s
nets you fifty thousand.
Fifty thousand...
That's a lot.
In the 100s, I think wins are worth a million.
What?
Once you're past the 150th floor,
you get ten million a pop.
Ten million?
Didn't you make it to floor 200
when you were here before?
Th-The 200th floor?
How much do you get for
winning on the 200th floor?
Well... I don't really know,
because I quit once I reached 200.
But when I was winning in the 190s,
I had around two hundred million, total.
T-Two hundred million...
Where's that money now?
That was four years ago.
Of course it's gone now.
Spent it all on snacks!
Two hundred million on snacks, in four years?
What kind of snacks are these?
Hey, let's head to the waiting room.
We didn't take any damage in the last fight,
so they'll probably assign us
another match today.
Well, these opponents should be a cinch.
Just take it easy.
Really?
Killua-san!
You're too loud...
#2054, Killua-sama.
I'm already up.
And #1963, Zushi-sama.
What?
Please head to arena A, on the 57th floor.
Oh.
Osu! I shall give it my best.
Sure. Well, you can't win them all.
Better luck next time.
I'll head out.
Yeah. Good luck, guys.
I'll wait for you above.
Uh-huh...
He really didn't have to be so blunt...
Okay, everyone!
The event you've all been waiting for!
We have a unique match-up for you!
Two young boys, fighting it out!
However, you don't want to
underestimate them!
Both had strong showings
in their first rounds!
They both advanced directly to the 50s!
We will now replay
their matches on the big screen!
Killua defeated his opponent in a flash!
One chop was all it took to knock him out!
Meanwhile, Zushi used martial arts
to punish his opponent,
scoring a flawless knockout
of a 200-plus kilogram giant!
Okay, everyone!
Are you ready to press
your gamble switches?
In that case, switch on!
All bets are in, and the odds favor Zushi!
Perhaps his martial arts
knowledge gives him an edge?
This is bad...
Killua-san is mad...
This match will consist of three,
three-minute rounds,
decided by the points and knockout system!
Begin!
I see.
His stance leaves few openings.
He's trained long and hard
to master that stance.
But he has no chance against me.
Wow... Killua is
boldly walking toward his opponent!
Sorry.
But I'm sticking to one chop per
match until I reach the 150s.
Clean hit!
Amazing!
Killua has knocked out another
opponent with only a single chop!
A clean hit and a knockdown
get him 2 points.
As you already know, under the
points and knockout system,
there are clean hits, critical hits,
and knockdowns.
Superb attacks count as "clean hits,"
worth one point apiece.
Unusually superb attacks
are classified as "critical hits,"
worth two points.
Knocking down your opponent
earns you one point.
After amassing ten points, you are
awarded a technical knockout.
Of course, if your opponent cannot
continue to fight after one hit,
you win due to a knockout!
That chop ended the fight, stupid.
Can you fight?
Yes, I'm okay!
He got up!
Zushi will continue!
Fight!
Did I hold back too much?
He's taken another hit!
Zushi has been knocked down!
But he's already standing up!
If you stand before the referee reaches you,
your opponent isn't awarded the point.
Tsk. Not bad.
So the same attack won't
work twice against you.
But something's wrong.
That attack was strong enough that a graze
should have rendered him unconscious.
Unbelievable...
He has dominating power and speed!
At this rate, I won't stand a chance!
I have to...
try it!
Oh! What's happening?
Killua has backed away!
Zushi!
So, an incredibly loud shout from a spectator
interrupted the fight,
but let's get started again!
Oh, Killua!
Over here!
See? I got sixty thousand.
How about you?
It took you a while to get here.
Yeah, I ran into a little trouble.
Then Zushi was pretty strong.
No, not at all.
He has potential.
One day, he'll be strong.
But right now,
he's just target practice for me.
His punches were weak...
I was completely able to knock him around.
But I couldn't defeat him.
Huh?
I received the TKO from points,
but I couldn't knock him out.
Further...
When he changed his stance,
his aura reminded me of my brother's.
I don't know what it was,
but it felt dangerous.
It must be some kind of technique.
His master
called it "Ren."
Forgive me, Master!
I thought I made myself clear, Zushi.
You were not supposed to use Ren yet.
Forgive me!
My opponent was so strong,
I couldn't help myself...
Sure. Wanting to win is good.
But your true goal lies beyond this.
At this tower's top floor.
Focus too much on simply winning a fight,
and you reduce your own potential.
Osu!
You must be prepared to lose a
thousand times while you're here.
Osu!
So he isn't supposed
to use Ren until he reaches the top floor?
The strongest fighters are at the top, right?
Gon, change in plans.
Huh?
I'm aiming to reach the top floor!
Uh-huh!
Actually, that was my goal all along.
Killua defeats another opponent
with one chop!
A knockout!
Oh! In the other arena,
Gon has knocked out another opponent
with a single push!
Each of them has won six
consecutive matches
over the past three days,
to reach the 100s without a scratch!
Killua's chop.
And Gon's push.
How far will they be able to go?
And who is going to be able to stop them?
Yay! A private room!
We won't have to worry about
money and lodging anymore.
I wouldn't be too sure about that.
If you drop
below the 100s, you have to
check out of this room.
A world of difference separates making it
to the 100s and staying in the 100s.
The 100th floor is like a ceiling.
A ceiling?
Once you pass it, you get special treatment.
So everyone focuses on holding their spot.
Some people will do anything it takes
to stay in the 100s.
You can waste a lot of time on them.
Be careful, Gon.
Yeah.
Gon wins another match
with a single push!
Guess I didn't need to worry about him.
Your prize money has been deposited
into the specified account.
You were right...
I've never seen so many zeros before...
And just a week ago, I was totally broke.
I'm a little annoyed.
Huh?
My first time here,
it took me two months to reach floor 150.
Meanwhile, you're breezing through.
But you were only six back then.
Well, that's true...
Oh, that's right.
I saw Zushi on TV earlier.
So did I.
He's still in the 50s.
I wonder what that Ren you sensed
could have been.
Maybe if we fight opponents higher up...
Or wouldn't it be faster to just ask Zushi?
Ren is one of the four major principles.
The four major principles for
disciplining your mind and body.
Fundamental to every martial art!
You must know "Ten," learn "Zetsu,"
achieve "Ren," and reach "Hatsu"!
This is all part of "Nen" training!
That covers everything!
I've no idea what you just said!
Zushi...
Are you sufficiently educated
that you can teach others?
Gon-kun, Killua-kun.
There's an old saying
that if you learn something piecemeal,
you'll end up knowing less
than when you started.
So a little knowledge is a dangerous thing?
But I want to know right now.
Because it's related to the secret
behind my brother's power.
Then, your brother is able to use Nen?
I need to know what Nen
and Ren even mean!
I'll agree to the full learning process
rather than a quick explanation!
And if you're willing to teach me,
I won't try to figure it out myself.
I understand.
Come with me to my residence.
What is Nen? What is Ren?
Killua believes they are related
to his brother's abilities.
Gon wishes to learn what these mean, as well.
Brush your teeth.

﻿Heavens Arena.
The 251-story, 991-meter
building is a mecca for fighters.
When combatants win a fight,
they may advance by one class,
and receive a corresponding reward.
After reaching the 100th floor,
you are assigned a private room.
After reaching the 200th floor,
you receive the right to challenge
the strongest fighters,
the Floor Masters, in an intense
battle of survival.
This is the best stage
a warrior could ask for.
Then, your brother is able to use Nen?
I need to know what Nen
and Ren even mean!
I'll agree to the full learning process
rather than a quick explanation!
I understand.
Nen x And x Nen
After Killua fought Zushi,
the young Shingen-ryu practitioner,
Zushi mentioned the four major principles.
Gon and Killua are about to learn the secret
of those principles from Zushi's master, Wing.
Do I have your attention?
Nen means to burn your own soul.
In other words,
it tests your strength of will.
Burn
Nen
And the four major principles are part
of a training curriculum for
strengthening your will.
Strengthening your will?
Training?
That's correct.
Ten
Focus
Ten means to focus your soul to a single point,
to increase awareness of your ego and goals.
Express
Zetsu
Zetsu means to express yourself in words.
Temper
Ren
Ren means to temper that will.
Act
Hatsu
And Hatsu means to act upon that will.
Four Major Principles
Focus
Express
Temper
Act
Ten.
Zetsu.
Ren.
Hatsu.
Those are the four major principles.
Killua-kun, Zushi tempered his "refusal
to lose," during his fight with you.
So, allow me to demonstrate.
Killua-kun...
I think I'm going to kill you now.
Are you ready?
Yeah, sure.
It's not happening.
Then I'll take this step-by-step.
First comes Ten.
I focus my soul into a single point.
Zetsu.
You can express yourself mentally or verbally.
I will kill you.
That was Ren.
If I temper my will enough,
then I can act. Hatsu.
If your will is strong enough,
you can make your opponent back down,
without moving a muscle.
The concept of bluffing derives from this.
Ren hardens that which is soft,
and you lose the ability to
correct an incorrect idea.
Therefore, you should avoid using Ren
until your soul has fully matured.
Right now, you boys and Zushi
should be training your souls.
Let's go, Gon.
If you wish to learn about Nen,
you should focus on mastering Ten.
If you master Ten,
you will no longer feel the pressure
of an opponent's will.
Thank you very much!
Wait up, Killua!
Zushi.
Yes, sir.
Let's begin training.
O-Osu!
First...
He was lying?
Yeah. The explanation made perfect sense,
and Wing is clearly very strong.
But his story had holes.
Huh?
Zushi's toughness.
He kept getting up after
I knocked him down.
I was getting irritated,
so I used all of my strength
during my last attack.
Brat!
Crap!
He flew out of the ring!
Even an amateur can see that
he's headed for the hospital!
Oh! He stood back up.
Zushi must be invincible.
Impossible.
However, the referee has awarded
a critical hit and knockdown.
Killua wins by TKO, with eleven total points.
Willpower didn't keep him standing.
He's hiding some other secret.
What's wrong, Zushi?
Your Ten is unstable.
Master...
Hmm?
Why did you lie to them?
Lie?
You mean my explanation?
Yes!
The four major principles are
Ten, Zetsu, Ren, and Hatsu.
But they don't mean what you said.
Did you lie because they aren't your students?
I didn't lie.
Nen is an important method
for training your soul.
Force
However, it's true that I can't teach Nen
to someone who is not a student.
So I used the other Nen as a hint,
to help them along.
If Nen is used the wrong way,
it can become a terrible weapon.
For example...
You could turn a piece of paper
into a blade to harm others,
while hardening your body,
as a defensive measure.
With enough work, anyone can use Nen.
That is why
you must be careful when
deciding to teach it.
Master...
I didn't
have a chance to read that book yet...
And that can of juice was mine...
S-Sorry...
It's time for the day's biggest match!
The rookies Killua and Gon have advanced
to the 190th floor without dropping a fight.
Will they be able to keep moving on?
Okay, everyone...
Get ready to press your gamble switches!
Unfortunately, your shove won't work on me.
That's because
I am as slippery as a snake,
with sharp fangs,
to bite at your vital points.
You may sport a vicious chop,
but you can't overcome these muscles!
That's because...
I'm totally ripped!
Begin!
Critical hit and knockdown...
Three points.
Knockout!
The winner is Gon!
Critical hit and knockdown...
Three points.
Knockout!
The winner is Killua!
Once again, Gon and Killua have knocked
out their opponents with one attack.
And both of them have
successfully cleared the 190s!
Both have advanced to the 200s!
They've already reached the 200s?!
Zushi.
Master!
Killua-kun and Gon-kun have
already reached the 200s?
Yes, they're amazing!
I need to train more...
Huh?
Master?
I have no choice.
Enjoy.
What's the 200th floor like?
Beats me.
I've never been up here before.
Wow!
The 200th floor is so fancy!
Where's the receptionist?
This way?
We finally made it.
Yeah.
What is this?
All of a sudden, it feels like
we're in a monster-filled jungle.
But this is an ordinary hallway.
Let's go.
We can do this!
This isn't working...
I can't move forward!
I don't want to move forward...
This is murderous intent,
aimed at us.
Hey! Who's there?
Show yourself!
Killua-sama and Gon-sama, correct?
The receptionist's desk is over here,
so please register for a 200s match today.
You won't be able to register
after midnight, so please be careful.
Was she the source of all that?
I can't tell.
By the way, there are currently
one hundred, seventy-three
contestants in the 200s class.
And starting from the 200s,
all weapons are allowed in matches.
So please use whatever you have.
Also, you will no longer receive
prize money in the 200s class.
You will fight only for glory,
so please understand that
if you're going to participate.
Huh?!
H-Hisoka...
Why are you here?
It's hardly that strange.
I love to fight,
and this is a temple to fighting.
And why are you here?
Just kidding...
This was no coincidence.
I've been waiting for you.
Remember how you ordered airship
tickets over the cybernet?
With a little effort,
it's possible to determine where
and when someone will arrive.
Well,
I knew you would come here eventually.
And so,
as a veteran, I have a warning for you.
It's still too early for you boys
to step on this floor.
How early depends on your efforts.
Leave for now.
It's too early right now.
That's stupid!
We just got up here...
I won't let you pass.
Not that you could, anyway.
Wh-What is...
...this?
Don't be reckless!
Wing-san!
You have no defense
against his Nen.
Nen?
Right now, you are like someone standing
naked in a blizzard, wondering why it is cold.
If you continue to strain
your body, you may die.
This is Nen?!
He can stop us from moving
forward through willpower?
Don't lie!
Yes, I was lying.
Though technically, I wasn't lying completely.
I will teach you the truth about Nen.
So retreat for now.
Hey, receptionist lady.
Oh, yes?
What happens if we don't register
for a fight today?
Gon-sama, you would have to
start again, from the first floor.
However, Killua-sama
refused to register once before.
So if he fails to register again,
his commitment will be questioned,
and he will be banned from participating.
Hey, Wing-san.
If we back down now,
will we be able to return here
by midnight?
That depends on you.
Simply put,
this is Nen.
Nen refers to the ability
to manipulate your aura,
Force
Nen
also known as life energy.
Every person possesses a
small amount of life energy.
But in most cases, it's simply discharged.
The ability to build up
a shroud of life energy is known as Ten.
Shroud
You can make your body harder,
Shroud
Ten
and considerably slow the effects of aging.
Then comes Zetsu.
Null
Zetsu
As you may guess, this nullifies your aura.
It is effective for
concealing your presence,
and recovering from extreme fatigue.
Which brings us to Ren.
Enhance
Ren
A technique to create an especially strong aura.
Can you feel that?
Yeah, I can feel the pressure.
But it doesn't feel dangerous.
That's because I have no hostile intent.
However, I must admit I am
impressed by their senses.
Perhaps it's because of
how they've grown up.
But their natural potential is
also a major factor.
Aura is an energy that comes
from within humans.
Which makes it very effective
against other humans.
For better or worse.
If you attack a helpless person, with ill intent,
you can use aura to kill.
Only one thing can protect you
from someone who uses Nen.
You must also learn to use Nen.
You must use Ten for defense.
Block the other person's aura with your own.
Otherwise...
Your body will be crushed.
Hisoka blocks the path leading
beyond the 200th floor.
Will Gon and Killua be able
to learn enough about
true Nen to pass Hisoka,
and reach the receptionist,
before the clock strikes midnight?
It's too early.
Coming up, we have Gon
and Killua's
Hunterpedia!
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit
It's Gon
and Killua's
Hunterpedia!
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
Today, we introduce Wing-san!
Master of Shingen-ryu.
Zushi's teacher.
He's Zushi's teacher!
And a master of Shingen-ryu!
Very serious about teaching Nen,
Seems he's pretty good with Nen.
but sloppy about everything else.
Oh, Wing-san's shirt isn't tucked in.
And his hair's a mess!
Next time: Awakening x And x Potential!
Did you feel anything?
Nope, nothing.
﻿Heavens Arena.
The 251-story, 991-meter
building is a mecca for fighters.
When combatants win a fight,
they may advance by one class,
and receive a corresponding reward.
After reaching the 100th floor,
you are assigned a private room.
After reaching the 200th floor,
you receive the right to challenge
the strongest fighters,
the Floor Masters, in an intense
battle of survival.
This is the best stage
a warrior could ask for.
Only one thing can protect you
from someone who uses Nen.
You must also learn to use Nen.
You must use Ten for defense.
Otherwise...
Your body will be crushed.
Awakening x And x Potential
As the hour grows late,
Wing's lecture has reached its climax.
But they only have until midnight.
Before that time,
Gon and Killua must learn Nen.
Nen is a power that dwells
within every person.
However, at present,
only a few are capable of using that power.
Thus, they are treated as
geniuses, leaders, psychics,
mystics, or superhumans.
A power that dwells within everyone...
Yes.
And there are two means
by which to awaken this power.
The deliberate way and the aggressive way.
Zushi underwent the deliberate method.
He was a quick learner, and he trained hard.
So he was able to master Ten
in a very short time.
In about six months.
That's too long...
We need to learn Ten,
and pass Hisoka's Nen barrier before midnight!
Then you'll have to try the aggressive method.
Will it be fast enough?
That will depend on you.
Can you learn to hold your aura within
your body, before time runs out?
That is the key.
I will now direct my aura toward you.
This is known as Hatsu,
which I demonstrated earlier.
Naturally, I will restrain myself,
since my objective is not
to destroy your bodies.
However, this way is still perilous.
In other words, I will attempt
to shock you into awakening.
I will give your sleeping body a jolt,
so you can learn Ten more easily.
I say that your body sleeps because
your body's openings,
or micropyles, are closed,
meaning that your aura flow is stunted.
Therefore,
I will send my aura into your bodies,
to open your micropyles.
[Micropyles]
Numerous pores in the body,
which release aura.
Under normal circumstances,
you would spend a long time
meditating and discovering your own auras,
while slowly opening those apertures.
Even Zushi, a natural talent,
required three months.
However, you two could do it in a week.
Or even sooner.
Which is why I find it unfortunate
that we have such little time to work with.
I don't really get it...
But quick and dirty is always better.
This is a shady, highly frowned upon method.
You will be ignoring the correct procedure.
You could even die,
if the person using this method
were weak or evil.
But you aren't weak, and you aren't evil.
Right?
That's why I want to know...
Shroud   Force
Null
Act
Why would you
suddenly decide to teach us the
true four major principles?
Because I did not want to
squander this opportunity.
If you were to challenge the 200s,
with none of this knowledge,
you would suffer greatly.
Up there, everyone knows
how to manipulate Nen.
And they have a special
greeting for any newcomer
ignorant of Nen,
a Nen attack.
In other words, they do what I am about to,
but without restraint.
They don't care, even if people die...
Only those who survive
are allowed to pass.
They are the chosen.
However, they pay a steep price.
That's why I wanted you to be prepared.
Now, despite my attempts to scare you,
I have confidence that this
will awaken your power!
You have the potential.
As well as the ability.
Put your belongings down,
take off your shirt,
and turn your backs toward me.
It's so hot!
And I can feel pressure, even though
Wing-san isn't touching me.
This is it! That sensation...
Like something invisible and slimy,
crawling across my skin.
Amplify this by millions of times,
and it'd feel like my brother's Nen ?
I'll begin.
Every micropyle on your bodies has opened.
Th-This is...
That is your aura, or life energy.
You can see it now,
because the micropyles in your
eyes were also opened.
It's like smoke.
Like steam, rising from the spout of a kettle.
It's rushing out from every part of my body.
It won't stop gushing out.
Isn't that dangerous?
This is your life energy,
so if it continues to escape,
you will grow tired.
If you expend all your aura,
you will collapse from fatigue.
Really?
Listen to me.
You must concentrate on keeping
your aura within your body.
Close your eyes!
Use any stance that helps you to focus.
Then visualize your aura flowing
like blood through your body.
From the top of your head,
to your right shoulder.
To your hand, before passing through
your legs, to the left side.
And now visualize that flow
beginning to ebb
and hovering around your body.
These boys are incredible.
I didn't need to tell them that a natural stance
would be the most effective.
With minimal advice, they've already
mastered the technique.
Magnificent...
And terrifying.
Slowly open your eyes.
How do you feel?
I feel like I'm surrounded by some
kind of warm mucus.
Yeah, like I'm wearing weightless clothes.
Continue to maintain those images.
Once you've assimilated them,
you'll be able to use Ten while asleep.
Next, I will use hostile Nen against you!
Previously, it would have
been painful for you to stand within this.
Yeah,
I understand your blizzard analogy now.
If you can fend off my Nen,
you'll be able to break through his barrier!
Here I come!
Welcome to the 200s.
It appears that I needn't bother
with the traditional greeting.
I can guess why you've come
to Heavens Arena.
You intended to train before challenging me...
Yeah, but I didn't expect to find you here.
That saves me time.
You should avoid being overconfident
in your ability to use Ten.
There is much to learn about Nen.
To be honest,
at present, I feel no urge to fight you.
However...
If you manage to win a single
match in the 200s,
I shall accept your challenge.
Let's go.
Yeah.
Newcomers?
Looks like it.
Seems that they can use it.
Indeed...
Welcome to the 200s!
Please fill out the forms here.
Would you like to register for a match now?
In this class, there is a self-service system
by which you're permitted
ninety days of preparation.
You may choose to fight on
any day during that time.
Of course, you're free to fight every day,
and you can also wait until
the very last day to fight.
Once you've participated in a fight,
you have another ninety days to prepare.
However, if you don't fight before
those ninety days end,
you will be disqualified,
and your name will be struck from all records.
Does that mean we'll be fighting
in this class multiple times?
Yes,
you need ten wins to clear this floor.
However, if you lose four times before ten wins,
you'll be disqualified.
And
if you win ten times,
you have a chance to challenge
the Floor Masters!
The Floor Masters are the twenty-one
strongest fighters here.
Each claims one of the floors,
from 230 to 250.
Do you understand now?
If you defeat a Floor Master,
you become the new master of that floor!
Th-That's not all!
If you become a Floor Master,
you earn the right to participate in
the biennial celebration of
combat, Battle Olympia!
No reaction?
Forget that.
Is there anything special about the top floor?
That's what you want to know?!
The champion of Battle Olympia
gets to live on the top floor!
It's an incredible honor.
A penthouse 1,000 meters above the ground...
Don't you get it?!
But Killua's house is 3,700 meters
above ground, right?
A-And the champion always
receives a prize of...
What do you wanna do, Gon?
Now that I know the top floor's secret,
I don't care anymore.
Yeah! I just want to fight with Hisoka.
Why are you kids even here?
Well, then you'll need to win a fight.
But you're gonna wait a bit first, right?
No...
I'm doing this!
I have to find out how different
these opponents are.
I'll need you to fill out this form, as well.
Okay!
You want something?
No, not really.
We're simply in line to register for a fight.
Oh, I get it.
Gon, these guys want to fight
on the day you do.
I'm ready to go whenever.
There you go.
This boy has plenty of spunk.
Then Gon-sama will be in room 2207.
Killua-sama will be in room 2223.
We will let you know which day your match is.
Thanks!
They must have gone through
that greeting Four-Eyes mentioned.
If we'd gone in blind,
we could've ended up like them.
Wow! This room is huge!
Hey, are you listening to me?
The bath is squeaky clean.
Whee... I've never seen such a big bed!
Look, Killua...
Hey, Gon!
Your battle has been set
for 3 PM, March 11th!!
What? Tomorrow?!
That's fast.
I probably won't be able to win tomorrow.
But that's okay.
I need the experience.
I need to discover what I
can do with this power.
Okay, we have a thrilling match for you today.
First, we have Gon, who managed
to zip straight to this class!
His opponent will be Gido,
who currently holds a respectable 4-1 record.
Listen to me, Gon-kun. Killua-kun.
Ten is a purely defensive technique.
You have not improved
your offensive capabilities.
Plus, you will still take damage
from physical attacks.
A highly skilled Nen opponent
will be able to penetrate your Ten,
and deal a lethal blow.
So you should wait two months
before you start fighting.
During that time, I will
teach you as much as I can.
Sorry, Wing-san.
But I'm itching to fight right now!
Good grief.
That boy is a real handful...
And...
Begin!
Dancing Tops
There they are, Gido's Dancing Tops!
He uses numerous tops to
attack his opponent!
Here we go...
Battle Waltz!
Clean hit!
Oh, Gon gives up a clean hit
and one point, right off the bat!
He's off to a rough start.
Damn!
I can use Nen
to keep these tops spinning
for hours, as my attack.
The attack pattern is so complex,
even I don't know what will come next!
Tops spinning into each other
and attacking me...
That small top deals damage
equivalent to a hammer!
Gon has begun his first battle of the
200s class, which is filled with Nen users.
The 200s class is nothing like he expected.
Can Gon survive this predicament?
Or not?

But I'm itching to fight right now!
Fierce x And x Ferocious
Gon is in his first 200s match,
but he's been caught off guard
by the unexpected nature
of his opponent's attack.
He's been hit from behind by another top!
Gon is in big trouble,
after having been surrounded by Dancing Tops!
Clean hit and knockdown!
Two points!
Gido has already earned four points!
Can you continue?
You bet!
There are too many tops for me to track.
Damn...
What should I do?
M-Master...
Is he using Nen?
Yes, that is a form of Hatsu.
He's projecting his aura into the tops.
That allows the tops
to move with more strength and
speed than normally possible.
Manipulating a small object requires
only a small amount of aura.
A large object requires a
larger amount of aura.
Gido is also using Nen in other ways here.
Those tops couldn't be so strong
were he simply using his aura to spin them.
It can only be accomplished
because he cares deeply about his tops.
Objects respond well
to those who are compatible.
I can't follow them with my eyes.
Nen is powering the tops!
I can sense it.
Yeah, I can sense them.
My Ten is fading!
Another direct hit!
Gon is completely helpless!
He's been knocked out of the ring!
The score is now 6-0!
He's dug himself a big hole!
It won't work...
If I focus on sensing the tops,
my Ten shroud will dissolve.
What should I do?
A top was knocked outside the ring?
But it isn't attacking me...
What's wrong? Can you continue fighting?
Be quiet! I'm thinking right now.
If you're not in the ring within a ten-count,
I'll rule you the loser!
One!
Now that I think about it,
the Nen in this top didn't feel hostile.
What about the others?
They're spinning around,
bumping into each other.
Maybe the tops aren't actually targeting me?
Four!
Why are you standing outside the ring?
If I stay in the ring, I'll get hurt!
Five!
Just as I thought...
This is like a game of sumo tops!
It's impossible to command tops
to move with precision.
It's likely Gido simply commands the tops
to strike anything in their way.
They spin around, striking whatever
happens to cross their paths.
Seven!
In that case, I don't need to fear the tops.
I can ignore the tops, and attack him!
Heh, you may have figured out my tops,
but you still can't land an attack!
There it is!
Gido's special technique,
combining offense and defense!
Tornado Top!
Tornado Top
He lands a strong counter on Gon!
Three points!
The judge has awarded a
critical hit and knockdown!
Gido has nine points!
Gon is on the verge of losing!
I turn myself into a top to protect myself,
while using my Dancing Tops to attack.
My strategy might be boring,
but it's effective for racking up points.
There are a number of ways to defeat Gido.
You can attack him until
he tires, and his Ten begins to fade.
You can use Hatsu that overpowers his defense.
Both methods require a large amount of aura.
However, Gon-kun doesn't know Ren,
the technique to instantly generate aura.
Learning how to quickly
create large amounts of aura,
and how to channel it into attacks,
requires endless training and
combat experience to learn.
He'd need five more years
before he could fight Gido.
I'm sure he's beginning to realize that now.
What should I do?
What will it take to prolong this match?
If he scores one more point, it's over.
But I want to keep fighting.
What can I do right now?
That would be...
Gon!
He released his Ten?
That's reckless!
But he didn't simply release it.
That's...
Zetsu...
The technique for concealing your presence!
Your aura also disappears because
your micropyles are sealed.
Any aura that normally escapes
your body is also nullified,
so he has no Nen protection!
I didn't teach him Zetsu use!
Did he learn it on his own, before we met?
In that case, he wouldn't realize
that this is Zetsu.
He must have learned it while
attempting to track a beast or other target...
The boy certainly has incredible potential.
But why would he use it now,
in this situation?
Idiot!
If you're hit by a Nen attack, without protection,
you'll be totally messed up!
I know that.
But in order to track the tops' complex
pathing with only sensations to go on,
I must focus all my senses...
Could it be that
he never expected to win?
He's risking his life...
Risking his life to train?
You don't want to live, kid?
Then I'll help you die!
What?!
Amazing!
It's the first time Gon has managed
to evade an attack!
I can feel them...
I know where they're heading!
This is all I can do right now...
Concentrate on dodging
my opponent's attacks!
I can still fight!
Your right radius and ulna were both broken.
Fractured humerus.
Three broken ribs.
Twelve other minor fractures.
Four months before you're
completely healed up.
You moron!
Sorry.
An apology won't help!
Do you have any brains in there?
Didn't you see what happened
to those who'd suffered
the traditional Nen greeting?
One wrong move, and you could
have ended up like them!
You're lucky not to be
hurt any worse.
Man, why do you think
Four-Eyes was training us?
Still...
I had a feeling I'd be okay.
I took a few hits,
but I wasn't in mortal danger, as long
as he missed my vital spots...
Come in.
Four-Eyes!
Uh, sorry...
An apology won't help!
What were you thinking?!
Didn't you see those who'd suffered
the traditional Nen greeting?
You could have ended up just like them!
Oh, that's what I just told him.
Honestly...
I'm glad you weren't injured any worse.
Wing-san, I really am sorry.
No, I won't let this one slide.
Killua-kun,
do you know when Gon-kun will
have recovered completely?
The doctor said it would take two months.
I understand.
Thank you, Killua.
In that case,
I won't allow you to participate in
any matches for two months!
I won't allow you to train in,
or study about, Nen.
If you don't abide by these rules,
I will never teach you again.
Well?
I understand. I'll do as you say.
Give me your left hand.
This is a promise thread.
It will be a visual reminder of your promise.
Killua-kun, a moment, please.
Killua-kun,
what is the true objective
you two are pursuing?
Well, we don't really have an objective.
Before running into Zushi and you,
my plan was to earn some quick cash.
Gon's here to train hard,
so he can defeat a guy named Hisoka.
That's it, really.
Looks like the others in the 200s
want to reach the top floor.
Battle Olympia, was it?
I'm not too interested.
Oh, Gon is...
Well, I'm not sure...
He said that he only wants to fight Hisoka.
But after seeing his match yesterday,
I have a feeling he enjoys the thrills...
How long will this exchange continue?
There are nearly fifty tops flying
around the ring!
Gon is evading the frightening
whirlwind of tops!
Gido has used up all of his tops,
and can only watch with the rest of us!
Not that way!
There's nowhere to run...
You say that he was enjoying a situation
that could have cost him his life?
Yeah.
I know because I've felt the same way.
Although I take circumstances
into consideration, too.
Once he's in the zone,
he loses sight of everything else.
Oh!
But he isn't the type to break a
promise twice, so you needn't worry.
Perhaps I have...
It's too late.
Because Gon and I already know.
If you regret teaching us
and decide to back out,
we'll find someone else,
or we'll learn it ourselves.
You don't have to feel responsible.
My brother and Hisoka can both use Nen,
so Gon and I were bound to
discover it eventually.
I understand.
And I mean to finish what I started.
There are many things I must tell you.
Zushi is waiting in my lodge.
You can train with him.
No, I'll pass.
Huh?
I won't leave Gon behind.
If he keeps his promise,
I'll start training when he does.
Tell Gon-kun this...
I will allow him to practice the other "Nen"!
Tell him to practice "Ten" daily!
Hey, Gon.
Master...
I may have
awakened an incredible beast...
Master?
What do you mean?
You found the agency on your own,
so you must be sharp.
But I can't recommend you to
one of our valued clients.
I have no problem with your lack of experience.
Some clients don't mind greenhorns.
But it isn't experience alone that you lack.
What do you mean?
I said that I have a Hunter License!
But your exam hasn't ended yet.
I can tell.
What?
Can you see anything?
Eh?
Next to me.
You can't see a thing, right?
Once you've learned to see,
return.
That's the bare minimum.
What does she mean?
What is it that I cannot see?
You can't see it, but you can sense it.
Why did you do that?!
This?
Well, I was just playing with you.
Fate had a hand in crossing our paths.
Consider this advice from a veteran...
You didn't notice when I stole this,
and you didn't notice when I walked past you.
Bastard... Return my Hunter License!
Can a newbie who knows nothing
of Nen defeat me?
Nen?
Wanna give it a try?
Understand now?
You still lack something.
I...
I need...
Enough power to fight on my own!
Come with me.
I'll be your teacher.
The real exam has only just begun.
Gon's hidden potential begins to awaken.
And Kurapika has also encountered
a new power that will help propel him forward.

Destiny x And x Tenacity
One month has passed
since Gon was badly injured
in his match with Gido.
In Heavens Arena,
all eyes are focused on a
certain upcoming match.
Gon, I got something good...
Oh, Killua,
I was about to go looking for you.
Uh...
Are you really healed?
Yeah!
See? I'm perfectly fine!
Okay, I get it.
Those injuries should've kept him
out of action for four months,
but he recovered in a month.
Man, what is your body made of?
How to answer that...
You're weird.
Well?
Weren't you about to say something?
Oh, here.
Tickets?
These aren't just tickets.
They're for Hisoka's fight.
As a 200s fighter, I got dibs on tickets.
The tickets to Hisoka's match
are a really hot item.
There are even scalpers hawking them.
Oh...
So I've been gathering information.
It turns out that Hisoka's the real deal.
He has an 8-3 record, with 6 KO's.
Each KO has led to death.
But he's lost three matches...
His three losses were due to forfeits.
Forfeits?
He reached the registration deadline,
so he signed up for a fight, but didn't show.
Which means...
If Hisoka actually fights, he doesn't lose.
Yeah.
And he's only given up a total of four points.
One knockdown, three clean hits.
He's as strong as a Floor Master.
I'm in trouble...
Jeez.
You don't look like someone who
thinks they're in trouble.
So, his opponent is some guy named Kastro.
Two years ago, he claimed the sole
knockdown against Hisoka.
And of the four points scored against Hisoka,
he's responsible for three.
He scored three points against Hisoka...
You could say they have a history.
Apparently, they both registered for the
same day so they could fight each other.
You should have the chance to
analyze Hisoka's fighting style.
Maybe we'll get to see Hisoka go all-out.
But is this okay?
I promised Wing-san...
I won't allow you to participate in
any matches for two months!
I won't allow you to train in,
or study about, Nen.
Of course it's okay!
You'll just be watching a match.
It is not okay!
Viewing a match counts as learning about Nen.
W-Wing-san...
Don't scare us.
Gon-kun,
has your arm healed?
Y-Yes! It's fine now.
He has unbelievable regenerative powers.
Since he's recovered, he can
watch the match, right?
No, I told Gon-kun to wait two months.
Gon-kun, you should spend one more month
practicing "Ten," and recovering
from your injuries.
Oh...
Okay, I understand.
Well,
then it's fine.
Osu! Take care.
Oh, well...
You'll have to watch a recording,
so I'll go and see it in person.
He's kept his promise.
He's only practiced "Ten" each day.
I can tell from the faint aura that surrounds him
under normal circumstances.
Their auras flow like serene rivers.
Master?
Hmm?
Oh, never mind...
It's nothing.
This won't do...
I'm the one who's losing control.
Hello! I'm your announcer, Cocco!
Today in Heavens Arena,
we have Kastro versus Hisoka,
the match you've all been waiting for!
Just look at this crowd!
The match doesn't start for another hour,
but the arena is already packed!
This is a promise thread.
It will be a visual reminder of your promise.
Two years ago, Hisoka was
the winner of their match.
The audience is fired up to
watch this match of destiny,
as Kastro looks for revenge!
Sporting an 8-3 record, with all three losses
being forfeits due to absence,
we have the deadly magician with the
tendency toward absence, Hisoka!
And opposing him, boasting a 9-1 record,
one win away from the Floor Masters after
nine straight wins since his loss to Hisoka,
we have the martial artist, Kastro!
Will he avenge his earlier loss,
as he's predicted?
Get ready for a battle between the two fighters
nearest to reaching the Floor Masters!
Oh? I expected some kind of macho gorilla...
Next up, we have an interview with
Kastro, from a few days ago.
I wouldn't fight if I didn't expect to win.
You'll see that I'm not the same
person I was two years ago.
Oh, he sounds confident...
We'll see if he can back it up.
Wh-What?
There he is.
Was there something you needed?
What?
R-Ridiculous.
He was just sitting on the couch...
When did he move?
Did he open the door and slip behind me,
without catching my attention?
No, that's impossible!
I never took my eyes off the door
until after he spoke.
He never had the chance.
How did he do this?
W-Well, I was hoping for an autograph.
From me?
You honor me,
Killua-kun.
I keep tabs on all my rivals in the 200s class.
You're not with Gon?
Oh, so you do know everything.
Are you here to scout an opponent?
Nope,
I just wanted a closer look.
And what do you think?
You're pretty damn good.
Thank you.
Your Zetsu was quite impressive.
However, you should have
concealed your presence
before reaching this floor.
When an aura as strong as yours disappears,
that would put most of us on alert.
You've been following up on me
since I reached this floor?
Pretty much.
Then I want to know...
How did you do that just now?
Unfortunately, I can't tell you.
After all, I might have to fight you someday.
Don't worry.
I'm not interested in fighting here again.
Really?
That isn't what your aura says.
That was a joke.
I'll answer your question when we fight.
I'll wait for you in Battle Olympia.
I'm sure you can get there.
I told you I'm not interested in fighting!
Yes, it's finally time...
The long-awaited rematch between
Hisoka and Kastro!
I'm very grateful, Hisoka.
If not for the initiation you gave me back then,
I'd never have become this strong.
You mean to imply that you're stronger now?
Just so you're aware,
I never used my full strength
in any of the nine matches after my loss to you.
Those matches were nothing more
than a warm-up for my defeat of you.
Begin!
Here I come!
A clean hit!
Kastro has landed the first strike!
What was that?
Give me your best shot, Hisoka.
Kastro is the one to land the first strike!
Hisoka has surrendered the first point,
after failing to evade Kastro's swift chop!
Again... An illusion?
I'm not the same person I was two years ago.
I won't hold back on my next attack.
You'll have my best shot when
I deem it necessary.
Very well.
Then I hope you'll change your mind soon.
Again...
I was sure he dodged that!
What's wrong?
Will you just run around, rather than attack?
Clean hit! And knockdown!
What an amazing start!
Kastro has been knocking his opponent around!
The score is now 4-0.
However, are my eyes deceiving me?
Have you still not changed your mind?
Would you prefer to die ignorant?
C-Can you fight?
If I am not mistaken,
you seemed to disappear...
That's right!
He disappeared!
That's what I saw!
No,
that is not an accurate description.
You were readying a kick from the front,
when suddenly, you were behind me.
I suppose that would be more precise.
But that doesn't sound right...
Something is off.
Yes,
I feel I'm missing something very basic here...
It's futile.
If you continue to run in circles,
you'll never learn the truth.
Because I'm done waiting.
I'll take your arm with my next strike.
If you still will not attack,
then so be it.
It seems you weren't good enough.
Tiger Bite Fist
He's going to use his Tiger Bite Fist!
Kastro's getting serious!
Tiger Bite Fist?
That technique
can split a tree in two, when used by a master.
Meanwhile, Hisoka still hasn't
figured out Kastro's ability.
Well, I don't really understand it, either.
At this rate, Hisoka's gonna die!
Here I come!
Go ahead and take it.
Not worried, huh?
Or is this meant to be a trap?
Either way,
I'll take your arm!
Your other one.
Hisoka's arm!
Hisoka's right arm has been severed!
You shouldn't assume that
I'll act the way you want.
This was just part of the plan.
What crap.
Have we ever seen Hisoka in
such a perilous situation?
He's taken considerable damage!
I understand.
Your ability is, in fact,
a double.
Impressive.
You are correct.
A double?
What does he mean?
Then it wasn't an illusion!
When Kastro attacked,
there really were two of him.
What is going on here?
Kastro has split into two?
Cloned himself?
Instead of disappearing, he's multiplying!
Does he actually have a twin?!
Is this your doppelganger?
Indeed.
Doppelganger?
Yes.
Master, what does that mean?
It refers to a double, as in an additional you.
When you spot someone who resembles you,
that's called a doppelganger.
Er, I don't get it...
When you encounter a doppelganger,
you experience headaches and fatigue,
which continue until your double is destroyed.
Some believe that the double
takes energy from the original.
B-But Kastro-san isn't suffering at all.
He's really strong.
That's only a story.
Besides, he mastered this
ability through training.
I listened to your warning,
and I watched carefully, rather than run.
And it turns out my deduction that
you disappeared was correct.
So why did I question that description?
That's because
I still sensed your presence beside me.
In fact, right before you disappeared,
I felt a new presence.
You duplicate yourself before disappearing.
I'm impressed that you managed to figure that out.
I was able to successfully create a double with Nen.
My double goes on the attack,
while I hide in the shadows.
As soon as you react,
I dismiss my double, and attack.
So those fluttering clothes were
meant to help him hide.
The most skilled Nen user would still experience
difficulty in figuring out
this trick, while in combat.
Naturally,
my double is no mere illusion.
It exists as a second me until I send it away.
You know this after suffering
an attack from my double.
In other words, you must fight both of my selves.
This is the true Tiger Bite Fist,
completed through the mastery of Nen.
I call it the True Tiger Bite Fist!
True Tiger Bite Fist
Incredible! We have an
upset in the making!
Hisoka, the winner two years ago,
is in deep trouble!
Will Kastro be able to avenge
his previous defeat?
Next, I will take your left arm.
Will you continue to act disinterested?
Hmm, let's see...
I think I have a little motivation now.
The fearsome double-user, Kastro,
and the magician, Hisoka.
Their incredible battle will have
an unthinkable end,
but Gon knows nothing of all this yet.

A x Surprising x Win
Kastro has used Nen to create
a double of himself.
And his special attack, the True Tiger Bite Fist,
has severed Hisoka's right arm.
Who will emerge victorious?
What's this?
Hisoka has covered his right arm with a scarf?
Shall I demonstrate my powers of clairvoyance?
Wow!
His right arm has disappeared,
and cards rain down!
What does he intend to do?!
Now, then...
I have cards here, from one to thirteen.
Pick a number from these,
and picture it in your head.
Pick a number?
Are you ready?
Once you have your number, add four,
and double the result.
After that, subtract six, and divide by two.
Finally, subtract your original number,
and what do you have?
Um...
Hey, did he say to subtract six?
Jeez, I don't know!
I already know your answer.
The answer is one.
He's right!
How?
Seriously?
This is very strange...
Insane!
A satanic magic trick!
And he's incorporated his own
injury into the trick!
Why is he so calm?
The trick is worth no points.
That had no effect on the match,
but he's performing tricks!
Hisoka is being totally bizarre again!
You may keep this as a souvenir.
Scumbag.
I will sever your left arm,
so you can never mock anyone again.
Did you not hear me the first time?
You may have it.
Your wish will be granted!
Whoa! One of the Kastros is charging forward!
Hisoka has sacrificed his one remaining arm!
What is he thinking?!
What?
As expected, you attacked with your double.
Had you, yourself, attacked,
I would have countered.
With this.
Huh? His severed right arm has been restored!
This is another magic trick.
Can you guess the secret behind it?
He's lying...
He's obviously employing Nen
to accomplish this feat.
But what type of Nen is he using?
What's wrong?
Are you frightened?
You're surprised because you
don't understand my trick.
That's how magic works.
Your power to create a double
is certainly magnificent.
But now I understand your ability.
I can also anticipate how you
will attack with your double.
And I know how to counter that attack.
It's quite unfortunate.
You have the talent to
become a skilled opponent.
That was why I spared your life.
Here is a prediction...
You will die, in a frenzied dance.
Silence!
H-How did he pick me out?
Doubles are created in the original's image,
so they tend to be pristine.
But you can't recreate every
effect of an ongoing battle.
Oh?
Did you not realize this?
What is going on here?
This sequence of events is
impossible to understand!
Is this another of Hisoka's tricks?
Don't bother.
I hit you in the chin,
so you'll have difficulty moving for a while.
Meaning that you won't be able
to evade my next attack.
What?
Where did this attack come from?
No, I don't have time for that...
I must use a double to block the cards!
You can't create another double.
You need intense focus to
create a double with Nen.
The only reason you were able
to use doubles freely
was because you had a normal state of mind.
Using Nen to replicate and manipulate
something as complex as a human being
is extremely difficult.
Just how difficult is it?
By the time you've learned to use a double,
you've forgotten how to use
Nen for anything else.
I call that running out of memory.
You lost because you wasted memory space.
Kastro can no longer stand!
Hisoka wins by knockout!
Hisoka...
Good work.
Now, show me that injury.
I was never absolutely certain,
but today's match confirmed it.
You are an idiot.
Perhaps.
Why do you endanger yourself this way?
Was that meant as a
performance or something?
Who knows?
Well, I can't complain, since I'm getting paid.
I'll stop your bleeding first.
Hey, hey.
Please try to be gentle.
Yeah, yeah. Just put away your aura.
I'll start with the left arm.
Here I go.
Nen Stitches.
Nen Stitches
Okay, all done.
Blood vessels, bones, nerves, and muscles.
Basically, it's one hundred percent connected.
An excellent job.
Next,
I'll do your right arm.
Hold it yourself this time.
I'm always mesmerized by your skill.
Perhaps I get myself injured
so I can watch you work your magic.
Right.
Twenty million for the left arm.
Fifty million for the right.
Pay up. Now.
I'll send the money to your account.
All right.
You can treat the rest of
your injuries yourself.
You could provide better service.
You should be able to manage
with your Bungee Gum
and Texture Surprise.
Oh...
I should probably conceal this.
That way,
they'll think my arms were
healed during the match.
This is an ordinary scarf,
with no special features.
I use Bungee Gum
to attach it to my arm.
Then I use Texture Surprise
to create a layer of skin.
He's so fast...
That was fast enough to fool a Nen master
into believing the arm had actually healed,
before he even knew what was happening.
Next, I'll do the left.
Bungee Gum...
Bungee Gum (Elastic Love)
He molds his aura into a substance
with the properties of rubber and gum.
It can stretch, swiftly contract,
adhere to most substances,
and be removed at any time.
By the way, I call this Bungee Gum
because when I was a child,
that was the name of my
favorite chewing gum.
I didn't need to know that.
Texture Surprise...
Texture Surprise (Flimsy Lies)
He combines aura with the power of his imagination,
to reproduce the appearance of skin.
Essentially, it's a high-quality copy,
so you can tell it's fake if you touch it.
However, Hisoka enjoys the thrill...
The name Texture Surprise
comes from the stickers
that were included with a popular snack
a while back.
Like I said, I didn't need to know that.
But weren't you impressed by my application
of these two abilities during the fight?
Huh?
You saw everything, didn't you?
Well, yeah...
As a distraction,
you sent thirteen cards flying into the air,
while throwing your arm and a scarf so they'd
stick to the roof and floor with Bungee Gum.
The aura from each was also tied
to your right arm.
Additionally, you connected aura to
the thirteen cards on the floor,
and held the ends with your left hand.
Then,
when you threw the ace of spades at Kastro,
You may keep this as a souvenir.
the aura in your left hand was released.
And connected.
The thirteen aura strands stuck to Kastro.
But Kastro never noticed.
You employed one of the basic techniques,
Zetsu, to help mask your aura.
However, there was a flaw...
Yes, someone trained in Ren,
another of the basic techniques,
could have focused the Nen in their eyes,
to see through your plan.
That's why you
used that twisted magic trick
to throw him off guard,
while you pretended to be
reserving your strength.
It even worked as camouflage,
convincing him that your lack of aura
was a sign of confidence.
After meticulously confirming
that your plan was working,
you extended a thread of
aura from your left hand,
the same one holding the cards,
and connected it to Kastro's chin.
Your preparations were now complete.
You'd already used Texture Surprise
to alter the scarf on the floor
to resemble human skin.
And so,
when Kastro attacked your left arm,
you activated the Bungee Gum
between your right arm and
the scarf on the floor.
Your arm was restored,
and the scarf concealed the wound,
leaving everyone convinced that
your right arm was restored.
However, this performance actually
helped Kastro to calm down.
It made no sense for a severed arm
to reappear in a pristine state...
Kastro realized that I was
using Nen, not magic.
But you didn't miss the subtle change
in his psychological state.
Your power to create a double
is certainly magnificent.
But now I understand your ability.
I can also anticipate how you
will attack with your double.
And I know how to counter that attack.
It's quite unfortunate.
You have the talent to
become a skilled opponent.
That was why I spared your life.
Kastro was about to recover.
Here is a prediction...
You will die, in a frenzied dance.
But then you pushed him over the edge.
Silence!
H-How did he pick me out?
But you can't recreate every
effect of an ongoing battle.
You exposed the weakness of his doubles.
But had he stayed composed,
he had a fair chance.
However...
Kastro couldn't bear the mental strain...
And he lost.
You realize that those two abilities
are perfect for you.
As opposed to Kastro's doubles,
if my opponent knows of my abilities,
I lose nothing because they're so adaptable.
Well,
I'm off.
Already?
My job is done, so I'm not sticking around.
Since Nen Stitches can only do so much,
don't overdo it until your arm's firmly attached.
Oh, that's right.
I came here for a reason.
I have new orders.
All Troupe members are to be in Yorknew City
by noon, August 30th, not just
those who find it convenient.
Will the boss be coming?
Most likely.
This could be our biggest job yet.
If you skip this one,
the boss might hunt you down himself.
How very scary.
Then, care to join me for dinner tonight?
A pity.
Killua! How was Hisoka's fight?
It was boring.
Did Hisoka win?
I was lying.
It was an incredible fight.
I hate to admit this, but I have
no idea how Hisoka won.
You couldn't tell?
Gon,
we need to learn more about Nen.
Yeah!
He doesn't talk.
He doesn't talk about the past.
He has no interest in the past.
By tomorrow, I imagine he'll
have forgotten Kastro's face.
He doesn't associate with others.
He's his own man.
Because he believes himself
to be the strongest.
Oh, I forgot to remove this.
Spider...
I found some new toys to play with.
I suppose it's time to start the hunt.
Hisoka has been masquerading
as a Phantom Troupe member.
To him, the Phantom Troupe
is simply another target.

Ah... Ah...
Achoo!
Do I have a cold?
I bet someone's talking about you
behind your back.
Is it Mito-san?
﻿Shroud
Ten.
The ability to build up a shroud of Nen aura.
You can make your body harder,
and considerably slow the effects of aging.
Null
Zetsu.
A technique that nullifies your Nen aura.
It is effective for concealing your presence,
and recovering from extreme fatigue.
Enhance
Ren.
A technique to create an
especially strong Nen aura.
This ability is crucial for increasing your power.
Act
Hatsu.
The release of your Nen aura,
after boosting via Ren.
These four elements are known
as the four major principles,
Four Major Principles
and are critical to the mastery of Nen.
Gon,
we need to learn more about Nen.
Yeah!
An x Empty x Threat
After two months, during which Gon
was forbidden to practice Nen,
Wing has summoned Gon
and Killua to see him.
Gon-kun. Killua-kun.
Starting today, you'll train with Zushi.
Gon-kun, I'm pleased
that you kept your word.
It's thanks to your promise thread.
A few times, I almost gave in.
But when I looked at the thread,
I was able to control myself.
That's because I added some Nen to help you.
Huh? Really?
No, I was lying.
Huh?
But how could you tell that he kept his word?
He could have been practicing in secret.
Because the promise thread remained intact.
Gon-kun, it's been a while,
but would you try using Ten ?
It's okay?
Yes.
Crap, do I remember how to do this?
It's been so long.
Can I still pull it off?
Zushi, what do you think?
I-It's amazing!
His aura is flowing all around him!
Soft and calm...
But it's very strong!
I did it!
Whew...
I was worried that I might
have forgotten how.
Once you've learned the technique,
you can't forget it.
However, to become a master,
you'll have to train hard.
But it felt easier than before,
despite not having been practicing Ten.
That's because
you were training your spirit each day.
Now, look at your left hand.
Huh?
It snapped!
By applying my own Nen,
I tied the thread such that
if you broke your promise and used Nen,
it would snap.
That's actually possible?
Hey, Wing-san...
Did you watch Kastro and Hisoka's match?
Yes, I did.
What was the ability that Hisoka used?
Could we send loose limbs flying around?
Hmm, that's a difficult question.
Gon-kun, have you seen the fight on video?
No, not yet.
Then I'll explain while we watch.
Can you see the threads of aura
extending from his left hand?
Threads of aura?
Yes.
Do you see them?
N-Nope.
I can't see a thing.
Same here.
Are there really threads of aura
coming from Hisoka's left hand?
Yes, Hisoka is using a technique
that makes his aura difficult to perceive.
Null
It's a high-level application of Zetsu, known as In.
Hide
When you use In,
even the strongest opponents will
find it hard to see your aura.
The most effective counter to this technique
Enhance
is to focus the aura created by Ren
into your eyes, a technique called Gyo.
Focus
The method Gon-kun used
in his fight with Gido
might work, as well.
However, you couldn't take offensive action,
so ultimately, you'd throw your life away.
Right.
My assignment for you two
is to practice Ren until you
can see through Hisoka's In.
Eh?
Uh, master?
What should I do?
Zushi,
you should already be strong
enough to see past his In.
I should?
Show them your Ren.
O-Osu!
Ren!
It's so strong.
It doesn't have a much greater magnitude,
but it's very dense.
Then direct that aura into your eyes.
Osu!
Gyo!
So, can you see the aura that emanates
from Hisoka's body?
Yes.
And how many threads are there?
Twelve...
No, I think it's thirteen.
Not quite.
But you were close.
I could really see them!
You're making excellent progress, Zushi.
O-Osu...
Thank you very much.
By channeling all your power through Gyo,
you achieved a level where you
could see through Hisoka's In.
But with enough training,
you'll be able to use Gyo while fighting.
Do you understand?
First, practice Ren,
and master the Ren application known as Gyo.
Then you'll discover the true nature
of Hisoka's ability.
And will you be able to use that same ability?
My answer is both yes and no.
Regardless of what Hisoka's precise power is,
so long as it uses Nen, you can learn it.
However,
Nen powers depend on the
particular individual.
Each of us possesses different
specialties and preferences.
Thus, Nen differs for each person.
If you're serious about mastering Nen,
you shouldn't merely copy others' abilities.
It's important that you first identify
your own strengths.
Strengths...
You've only just begun to develop.
You haven't settled on one form yet.
Initially, try to grow as much as you can.
That is the purpose of this training.
Train hard,
play hard, and enjoy life.
Osu!
The final day of Killua-kun's
window to fight is June 9th,
and Gon-kun's is the 10th, correct?
I'd like you both to register for your final day.
In the meantime, you'll train.
You must learn Gyo
before it's time for your battle.
Osu!
Your Ren was impressive, Zushi.
You moved way ahead while I was resting.
No, I still have a long path before me.
Hey, let's practice what we just learned.
Yeah, then let's go to your room, Gon.
Okay.
Killua... Zushi.
Osu!
We have company.
You guys don't know when to quit.
That's why no one likes you.
Oh, don't be so harsh.
Tell me when you're going to fight,
because I'd love to be your opponent.
I guess they specialize in hunting newbies.
They want to rack up wins
by beating us up.
We're getting desperate...
Because our deadline is nearing.
Come on, let's fight.
I'll even demonstrate my power
right now.
I'm fighting on June 10th.
Hey, Gon!
That won't work.
My deadline is May 29th.
Fight on that day.
Who cares about your deadline, moron?
Let's go.
Gon-chan...
You and I will fight.
I guarantee it.
Gon, ignore him.
What will you do?
I'll force him to fight me.
Visualize the energy building in your body.
Power gathers in each cell, and grows.
Then you force that power
out!
I'm getting used to this.
Learning when to shroud the
boosted aura with Ten
was a little tricky.
A-A little?
They pick it up too fast!
But our auras still aren't as strong as Zushi's.
Guess we should practice more.
N-No, that's enough!
Learning when to rest is part of training.
Let's call it a day.
Really? I can stillâ€”
No!
If they pass me in half a day,
I'll lose all my motivation...
Oh...
Well, it's okay.
We'll practice more tomorrow.
Yeah.
See you tomorrow.
Bye.
Okay, then...
I can't...
I can't move!
I can't talk or breathe...
What's going on?
Oops.
Please...
Forget it.
I figured you were up to something.
But you don't need dirty tricks
to make me fight you.
When do you want to fight?
Don't worry.
I'll let you win.
I'll even give you each a win.
Is that good enough?
After I get my win off you,
I'm going to fight Gon-chan.
If you want to fight Gon,
you'll have to follow his schedule.
He'll be more than happy to fight you.
I can promise you that.
Okay.
If you two are willing to fight,
we don't need to bother with this.
Let's go register together.
Once that's done, I'll return the boy unharmed.
Yeah, yeah. Sure...
But only this once.
May 29th...
Okay, happy now?
Yes,
we'll return him.
Oh, just to reiterate, it's a one-time deal.
If you break your promise...
Eh... Whatever.
Forget it.
What? You got me curious.
What will happen if we break our promise?
No point in telling you now.
Just keep your word.
Hello? Is this Gon-kun?
I'm sure you'll understand what this means.
As long as you don't tell anyone,
and you follow my instructions,
the three of you will be able to
train as usual tomorrow.
Zushi...
How did it go with Gon-chan?
Perfect.
He's registered for the 30th.
That's two wins.
Too easy.
Not killing people is pretty hard.
Clean living's tough...
Come on down! We have tickets!
These are fresh off the press...
Gon versus Sadaso!
And here's Killua versus Sadaso...
If you don't buy now, you'll regret it!
Pops.
Yep?
Does Sadaso have only one arm?
Yeah, the one-armed fighter,
with the mask-like face.
If he catches you with his
invisible left arm, you're finished.
They call him the newbie crusher...
That bastard.
Huh? Killua?
Gon, you were here?
Y-Yeah...
Killua-kun,
I believe you helped Zushi last night.
Thank you.
You feeling all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I was probably tired.
Sorry to worry you!
Oh, Wing-san...
Can we watch that video again?
I've learned how to use Gyo.
Really?
Fifteen threads, right?
Thirteen for the cards, one for the scarf,
and a well hidden one that
leads to the arm he tossed.
Continue.
Hisoka is...
Hisoka's aura appears
to expand and contract.
Or does it
attract certain objects, similar to a magnet?
Why else would his arm reattach?
Or fly into his opponent's chin?
It's probably the former.
His aura is elastic, like rubber.
That would explain most of his tricks.
He's on a completely different level!
Very good... You pass.
But I am surprised...
I didn't expect you both to learn Gyo overnight.
Gon?
Uh-huh,
but I still couldn't figure out Hisoka's power.
So, Killua-kun,
since you finished your assignment,
I assume you want to fight, yes?
O-Oh, I wasn't trying to
beat you to the punch.
I just got an itch to fight.
Yeah, I get it.
Gon, they must have threatened you.
Actually, I've already chosen my day to fight.
May 29th.
Mine's May 30th.
That's fine.
I underestimated how fast you could learn.
Spend the remaining days practicing Ten and Ren.
Be sure you get plenty
of practice, rest, and sleep.
Osu!
Killua...
They must have threatened you.
Now I'm mad...
Yeah, but my biggest concern
was the master, and he agreed.
But I'm worried they'll use Zushi again.
It'll be okay.
You don't need to worry.
Today, I'll beat Killua-chan for my sixth win.
Tomorrow, I'll beat Gon-chan
for my seventh win.
Then I just need to find three more chumps.
And I'll be a Floor Master.
I'll get all the wealth and glory to
set me up for the rest of my life.
Move, and I will kill you...
Use Nen, and I will kill you.
Make a sound, and I will kill you.
If you understand, slowly close your eyes.
Do you know what happens
if you break your word?
If you know, slowly open your eyes.
Look at me in the mirror, and listen carefully.
Never show your filthy face to us again.
That's a promise.
Time has run out for Sadaso!
Killua wins by default!
Damn, I want my money back!
Killua opens the battle
against the persistent trio
with a win by default.
Thanks to their inborn talent,
Gon and Killua are learning Nen
at incredible speeds.
Now they will start the real battle
at Heavens Arena.
Brush Your Teeth.

Today, we introduce Sadaso.
A Heavens Arena
200s-class warrior.
He underwent the traditional greeting
with Gido and Riehlvelt.
Alters his Nen to form
an invisible left arm.
Yeah?
His invisible left arm is made of Nen.
Yeah?
Oh.
Yeah?
Next time: Power x To x Avenge!
Power, yeah?
Avenge, yeah?
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?
﻿Heavens Arena.
The 251-story, 991-meter building
is a mecca for fighters.
When combatants win a fight,
they may advance by one class,
and receive a corresponding reward.
After reaching the 100th floor,
you are assigned a private room.
After reaching the 200th floor,
you receive the right to challenge
the strongest fighters,
the Floor Masters, in an
intense battle of survival.
This is the best stage
a warrior could ask for.
Today, I'll beat Killua-chan for my sixth win.
Tomorrow, I'll beat Gon-chan
for my seventh win.
Then I just need to find three more chumps.
And I'll be a Floor Master.
I'll get all the wealth and glory to
set me up for the rest of my life.
Move, and I will kill you...
Use Nen, and I will kill you.
Make a sound, and I will kill you.
If you understand, slowly close your eyes.
Do you know what happens
if you break your word?
If you know, slowly open your eyes.
Look at me in the mirror, and listen carefully.
Never show your filthy face to us again.
That's a promise.
Power x To x Avenge
There are many who would use
underhanded tactics to become a Floor Master.
On the other hand,
Gon has concentrated on improving
his Nen and growing stronger.
And tonight,
he has his battle with Sadaso.
His eyes reflected his underworld affiliations.
I was overcome with despair.
The second he looked at me,
I felt a difference in strength
that made me realize my
helplessness against him.
It was a mistake to underestimate him,
and to assume he was some normal kid.
I'm gonna disappear
because I don't wanna die...
Be careful.
You guys are next.
What should we do?
I'm still in.
I'll do whatever it takes.
I'm this close to becoming a Floor Master.
Ten victories in the 200s
win you the right to challenge a Floor Master.
Should you triumph, you get
an entire floor to yourself.
And once you've earned the
title of Floor Master,
you can lecture, serve as an advisor,
or start a new martial arts school.
You can live off the title for
the rest of your life.
Will that kid try threatening us?
The boy doesn't know my power.
As long as we're careful, we can handle him.
You're wrong.
It's irrelevant to me what your power is.
I can threaten you whenever I want.
Whenever and wherever I choose...
When you're sound asleep...
When you're taking a dump.
Got it?
Now, listen up.
You have to follow the rules.
Without rules,
we are the ones who would benefit.
Cheating really is a bad idea.
We'll have a fair fight.
Right.
Time has run out for Sadaso.
Gon wins by default!
What? Again?
What is Sadaso doing?
June 1st
June 2nd
June 3rd
June 4th
Okay, Gon-kun is fighting Gido today.
Killua-kun will be facing Riehlvelt.
Are you feeling all right?
Yes.
Gon-kun, this will be your
second match with Gido.
So you shouldn't require much advice.
Do you have a plan?
Uh-huh.
Um, Wing-san, actually...
I'm planning to use this.
I see...
Okay, today is the long-awaited grudge match...
Gido versus Gon.
In their previous encounter,
Gon ended up in the hospital,
but what will happen this time?
Today, he's carrying a fishing rod.
How does he plan to use it?
How does he intend to fight?
Let's get this contest started!
Points and KO system.
No time limit!
Begin!
Wow! Gon's already taken off!
But Gido was also prepared, as he's
already using Tornado Top!
If Gon charges in,
he'll be in the same position as before.
So he anticipated that.
I know exactly what you're thinking...
Once I've begun to spin,
it's extremely hard to stop me.
Thus, the logical course
would be a preemptive attack before I start.
What's wrong?
If you won't make a move, I'll go first.
Shotgun Blues!
Shotgun Blues
He can dispatch his tops, even while spinning?
This technique is nothing like Battle Waltz.
Every top will be aiming for you.
You can't avoid them all!
Ren!
What?
He stopped them!
Did you see that?
Wow...
Incredible!
He stopped the tops in their tracks!
He clearly isn't the same
person as two months ago!
His Nen defense is far stronger now.
I can't win with my tops?
Gon's reflexes are good enough
to let him use his rod to knock down any tops
that are stupid enough to come straight at him.
But he chose to use Ren
to deal more psychological damage.
He must be pretty mad
about how they used Zushi.
It's my turn now!
Well, what technique will Gon use?
If he's attacking with that fishing rod, I'd guess
he'll try to snag me, to stop my spinning.
But it won't be that simple.
There he goes...
Straight for Gido!
I knew it.
But that won't do you any good!
Oh, his attack missed!
What were you aiming at?
What?!
Unbelievable...
Gon pulled up the floor, with Gido on it!
Wait!
G-Gon has broken Gido's prosthetic leg.
Gido can no longer continue to fight.
If you're willing to do whatever it takes,
I won't hold back.
And if you touch Zushi again,
I'll smash your face in!
Our winner is Gon!
Gon was able to avenge his initial loss!
His record in the 200s is now 2-1!
Okay, it's my turn now.
All right, up next is our main event...
Killua versus Riehlvelt!
Because Sadaso forfeited the previous match,
this will technically be Killua's debut 200s match.
What will his strategy be?
You're the ones who broke your promise.
I won't let you win now.
His eyes reflected his underworld affiliations.
An underworld dweller, huh?
This boy may be a professional there,
but Heavens Arena is my turf.
I'll show him that, on this square stage,
I'm better.
Fight, Killua-san!
Points and KO system.
No time limit!
Begin!
He disappeared?
Behind me!
Aura Burst!
Aura Burst
Wow, he's dashed out of harm's way!
He uses the propulsion created
by releasing his stored aura
to control his wheelchair at will.
I moved too fast.
Whew, that was close...
Twin Snakes:
Song of Defense!
Song of Defense
There it is!
His Song of Defense...
Riehlvelt protects himself with two
whips moving at ridiculous speed,
while he awaits his opportunity to strike.
You planned to attack first and take the lead.
Too bad it didn't work...
Now that I've switched to this stance,
you have no chance of winning.
Why not?
That should be obvious.
A normal person can't even see the whips move!
And this small ring offers no
means to hide or escape.
Take this!
Sorry, but I'm not a normal person.
What?!
But...
Thunder Snake!
True Twin Snakes: Thunder Snake
I'm astonished, Killua.
You're the first person I've fought
who could see my whips move.
So I have a present for you...
Together, my whips carry a
one million volt current.
Enough to paralyze and
incapacitate the largest of men.
Any fool who resists my whips
will fall prey to Thunder Snake!
I'm accustomed to electrical currents
from the torture training I've endured.
It has no effect on me.
But that just means I can bear the pain.
It still hurts.
That's why I'm a little pissed.
If you fall from that height, you'll die!
What do you want?
P-Please catch me!
Okay.
Just come to me.
Man, you realize how painful it is now, idiot?
Riehlvelt has been knocked unconscious.
Our winner is Killua!
Nice, Killua!
You're up next.
You're fighting him in six days?
Uh-huh, June 10th.
My win was only possible
because of who I am...
If you're hit by those electric whips,
you'll be knocked out cold.
Yeah.
What's your plan?
Don't worry. I have an idea.
Oh?
In spirit, you were fighting
even as you watched me.
I guess you prefer actual combat
to being a spectator.
June 9th
It appears that the damage
Gido suffered in his match
with Gon was so severe,
he hasn't returned for today's fight.
Killua wins by default.
June 10th
After losing to Killua,
Riehlvelt's record stands at 5-3,
leaving him no more chances.
As you know, after four losses,
you're out of the contest.
You'll have to start over from the beginning.
He appears wary of Gon's speed,
as he already has his whips out.
Meanwhile, Gon isn't carrying his fishing rod...
How does he plan to fight?
Begin!
Oh, Riehlvelt opened with Song of Defense!
Riehlvelt is attempting to end the fight now!
Oh, Gon is squatting?
Amazing...
He pried a floor tile loose by himself!
And then he threw it!
Aura Burst!
Whoa, he barely managed to escape!
He left that escape route open on purpose.
What?
However, Gon has already anticipated him.
When you try to escape,
every fraction of a second counts.
And since there isn't time to change direction,
you're forced to move forward...
And when you dash quickly,
you're usually off-balance.
His only option is to stop the whips.
That's where you get him...
This is the switch?
Let's see...
I'll turn the power to maximum.
S-Stop...
Switch
Stop it!
on!
Just kidding.
Riehlvelt has fallen unconscious.
Our winner is Gon!
Gon-san!
Yes, that truly was impressive.
I can see the progress you've made
from these last two fights.
Feel free to pick a time and place...
I shall be your opponent.
Hisoka has recognized the strength
Gon demonstrated during his matches.
Their fight will soon begin.

The release of your Nen aura,

Four Major Principles
and are critical to the mastery of Nen.
Yes, that truly was impressive.
I can see the progress you've made
from these last two fights.
Feel free to pick a time and place...
I shall be your opponent.
The x True x Pass
Gon has obtained Hisoka's consent to fight him,
so he continues to train hard in Nen to prepare.
Today, we will finally begin to train in Hatsu.
Act
Once you master Hatsu,
you will have learned the basic Nen principles.
After that, you will need to work
on developing your individual Nen style.
Osu!
Hatsu is the technique
by which you control your Nen.
It is the culmination of Nen,
and there are six distinct categories.
Enhancer
Enhancers are able to strengthen objects.
Emitter
Emitters can propel their aura.
Transmuter
Transmuters can alter their aura's qualities.
Conjurer
Conjurers are able to manifest their aura.
Manipulator
Manipulators can use their aura
to control objects and creatures.
Specialist
Specialists are those with a
special aura that doesn't fall
within the other five classes.
The key is to find the power that suits you.
Enhancer
Emitter
Transmuter
Conjurer
Manipulator
Specialist
The power that suits you?
Nen is linked to individual ability,
with two areas of particular prominence.
The first would be your natural potential.
The second would be potential
refined later in life.
Gon-kun, for example,
was born with a flexible, springy body.
His acute senses were the product
of a childhood spent in nature.
From the moment of birth, your Nen aura
falls within one of the six categories.
While rare, it is possible for your
Nen aura to later change types.
If you attempt to learn an ability
that does not fit your inclination,
you will find it very difficult.
Act
Enhancer
Transmuter
Conjurer
Specialist
Emitter
Manipulator
This hexagon depicts the relationship
among the six categories.
The closer a class is to your own,
the higher your compatibility to learn it.
If you are born with an aura
of the Enhancer category,
you will find Enhancer abilities easiest
to learn and master.
And the adjacent Transmuter and Emitter classes
will also be easy to learn.
On the other hand, the Specialist class,
which is furthest away, would be difficult.
To illustrate, I'll use skills
that you've seen for yourselves.
Hisoka was able to change
his aura into a rubbery substance.
This would be a Transmuter ability.
Gido used his tops and body as
weapons by making them spin faster,
which would be an Enhancer power.
However, since using so many tops as weapons
also requires Manipulator skill,
he wasn't as successful.
As for Kastro,
his Tiger Bite was incredibly strong.
Had he mastered it, he would have
been among the strongest Nen users.
I believe that his aura fell
into the Enhancer class.
However, he focused his energy on
the power to create a double,
which is a Conjurer skill.
And he also required a Manipulator
ability to control the double.
Both of those are relatively far
from the Enhancer category.
So neither was compatible
with an Enhancer type?
Indeed, it requires a great deal of work and
natural talent to learn an incompatible ability.
And as a result,
he squandered most of his Nen potential.
So he made the wrong choice.
He was a great fighter...
It's a shame.
Well?
Do you see the importance
of understanding your own
auras and inclinations?
Osu!
Given that,
is there any way to learn which
category your aura falls into?
There is.
Water Divination,
a Shingen-ryu technique for classifying your aura.
It's also used in Hatsu training.
You place your hands beside
the cup, and use Ren.
The result will reveal your category.
The water's overflowing...
If the amount of water changes,
that means you are an Enhancer.
This shows that my aura falls
within the Enhancer class.
Okay, now it's your turn.
Gon's an Enhancer, too?
The leaf moved!
If the leaf moves, that makes you a Manipulator.
Okay, I'm last!
Nothing's happening.
Indeed...
The leaf isn't moving.
Do I not have any potential?
Not at all.
Taste the water.
Taste it?
It might be a little sweet...
You're right.
Yes, it's a bit sweet.
Isn't this just water?
It's just water.
But the taste changed.
Because of Killua-kun's aura.
And that means?
You are a Transmuter.
Oh!
A Transmuter?
Now, you three know
how your auras are classified.
Use the next four weeks
to train hard, so the Water Divination
results become more pronounced.
Osu!
June 11th
June 16th
June 20th
Hello?
This is Gon.
Ah, I have been waiting...
Have you decided when we should fight?
Yeah, July 10th.
That's the day!
Okay.
I can hardly wait...
June 22nd
June 30th
July 5th
Now, show me what you've
accomplished with your training.
Killua-kun, you're first.
Okay.
I'm done.
It's sweet!
Wow, it tastes like honey.
Excellent.
Zushi, you're next.
Osu!
This is the best I can manage...
That's fine.
But it won't be enough to pass.
You'll need to train some more.
Osu.
Gon-kun, you're next.
Osu!
Stop...
Stop, Gon-kun!
The water increased with so
much force, it cracked the glass.
Honestly...
You really are something.
I was feeling pretty good about this.
Gon-kun, Killua-kun.
Today is your graduation day.
Huh?
Really?
We did it, Killua!
Yeah.
Master, what about me?
You still need to train a bit more.
Osu.
Keep at it.
You can do it!
Osu...
And, Gon-kun...
Huh?
I have something important to tell you.
Something important?
Gon Freecss-kun, you have passed
the Secret Hunter Exam!
Huh?
You've passed.
Congratulations.
The Secret Hunter Exam?
Correct.
You were able to pass.
What do you mean?
You are required to learn Nen
before becoming a Hunter,
as professional Hunters are
expected to be exceptionally strong.
One of your basic tasks
as a Hunter will be apprehending
evil poachers and criminals.
You must be strong enough to fight crime.
However, this power is highly
destructive when used for wrongdoing.
Revealing the existence of Nen
during the Exam would be dangerous.
Therefore,
the test is only administered to
those who pass the public Exam.
Oh, so you were going to teach us,
or at least Gon, all along...
Yes.
I should mention that the
head Shingen-ryu master
is Chairman Netero.
The master has told me much about you.
That old man...
Killua-kun.
Please take the Hunter Exam again.
You will definitely pass next time.
Huh?
Yeah.
You are more than qualified.
I guarantee it.
Yeah, if I feel up to it.
Hey, Wing-san...
Have you heard anything about
the others who passed?
Sure.
Hanzo and Kurapika
have learned Nen from other teachers.
Pokkle is struggling with Ren.
Leorio has begun studying for
the medical school exam.
Hisoka and Illumi already knew Nen,
so they were qualified.
Then Kurapika and Leorio are working hard.
Yeah.
Now, Gon-kun,
I have one warning for you.
When you fight Hisoka tomorrow,
don't push yourself too hard.
All right?
Yes, sir!
Zushi, you will continue
training for four more weeks.
Osu...
You should have more confidence.
You are progressing at an incredible pace.
You're a one-in-a-hundred-thousand talent.
One in a hundred thousand?
O-Osu!
However,
those two are one-in-ten-million talents.
Osu!
That doesn't make me feel any better, master...
But...
One day,
I will definitely catch up!
Hello, everyone!
In the arena today, we have Gon versus Hisoka.
This is the fight you've all been waiting for.
As you can see, the stands are packed.
The tension in the air before the
start of this match is almost unreal!
How much longer?
Get this thing started!
Gon is the first to arrive!
After four fights, he has a 3-1 record.
He's on a roll!
You can do it, Gon!
Don't you need your fishing rod?
You can't catch Hisoka with your bare hands!
And next, with a fiery display...
Hisoka appears!
His lethal battle with Kastro is still fresh
in everyone's minds.
His record is 9-3.
If he wins, he can challenge a Floor Master.
If he loses, he falls all the way down.
However, he has yet to lose
when he steps into the ring!
Will his undefeated record continue?
Oh...
Don't look at me like that.
Schwing
I'm getting turned on.
What a sinister aura.
Gon-kun, don't overdo it.
Points and KO system.
No time limit!
One round!
Begin!
This is the match you've been waiting for.
The die has been cast!
Who will make the first move?
It's Gon!
A clean hit!
One point to Hisoka!
Wh-What an intense exchange.
I never even got to sneak in a word!
What's wrong?
I still haven't moved a step from where I started.
Huh? Really?
Damn!
Just you wait!
Okay, I don't have to try to
hit him with every attack.
I can use some feints to get the same effect.
Hisoka's enjoying himself.
In terms of actual skill,
there's an insurmountable gap.
But he still has a weakness.
Hisoka knows that he's stronger,
so he won't retreat.
That gives Gon an opening!
In that case, I'll try that!
There it is!
Gon's Stone Flip!
He shattered the block to
create a hail of rubble.
Gon...
Where is he?
Gon has finally landed a solid hit on Hisoka.
However, he will soon receive a taste
of Hisoka's true power.
Brush Your Teeth.

Don't look at me like that.
Schwing
I'm getting turned on.
A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick
Gon was able to land a solid
punch to Hisoka's face.
Will he be able to win the match?
Critical!
Two points for Gon!
Amazing! Gon managed
to land a critical hit!
He's come back to take a 2-1 lead.
Gon is on top!
However,
it appears that his punch hasn't
dealt much damage to Hisoka.
I have to question the referee's decision...
The referee is entitled to award
points as he pleases.
Huh?
Some referees award points based
on the amount of damage done,
while some base scores on
strategy and technique.
I believe the referee in this case
was rewarding the fighter for
using the stone block in his attack.
I see...
So, who are you?
Okay!
O-Oh...
For the first time in this fight,
Hisoka has moved!
And he's smiling ever so slightly.
Is he finally getting serious?
What was that about?!
I have no idea!
How much have you learned
about Nen?
All of the basics.
I see.
You must be an Enhancer.
H-How did you know?
You're so adorable...
You should do a better job
of keeping a secret.
Shut up!
How did you know?
I used a method similar to the
blood type personality test.
And it's just as unreliable.
I devised my own way of using
personality to classify aura.
Enhancers are simple and earnest.
He nailed it.
He's right.
By the way, I'm a Transmuter,
fickle and dishonest.
It fits.
He nailed it.
Emitters have short tempers.
Specialists are independent.
Conjurers are high-strung.
Manipulators are argumentative.
The two of us are quite compatible.
Our opposing personalities attract.
We could become very intimate.
But you should take care,
because Transmuters are fickle.
It takes a mere second for
treasure to turn to trash.
So...
Do not disappoint me, Gon.
He's fast!
Wh-What a strong kick.
He sent that stone block flying
all the way to the entrance!
Fast, fast, fast!
Hisoka is demonstrating his true power.
Critical for Hisoka!
Add points.
3-2!
His nonstop flurry of attacks has been scored
as a critical strike.
He's regained the lead.
Gon appears to be confused...
Does he have no way to fight back?
He's backing off.
Amazing...
Too amazing.
What's wrong?
Attack me.
Forget it.
I'm brainstorming!
I can just barely follow him by eye,
but the rest of my body can't keep up.
At this rate, he'll beat the crap out of me!
Very well.
Then I'll have to force you
to come over here...
Gon, use Gyo !
Crap!
Do you understand
what is happening?
Gon has been drawn toward Hisoka!
This is my Elastic Love...
Also known as Bungee Gum.
It can expand and contract.
And attach and detach as I desire...
You won't be able to escape.
Critical and down.
Plus three points to Hisoka.
6-2!
Hisoka hits him with a strong straight right!
Gon is down!
He turns his aura into a rubbery substance
capable of attaching to other objects.
Bungee Gum.
Tsk.
Only Hisoka can attach and detach it.
Stand up, Gon...
Damn.
The score is 6-2.
Hisoka increases his lead.
Will his undefeated record continue?
Stand up, kid!
Hey, ref! You're helping Hisoka too much!
You can do it!
Can you fight?
Of course.
Oh, Gon is standing...
But he's sustained significant damage!
Okay, I have a question for you.
Huh?
If you answer correctly, I'll give you a free hit.
What?
When did I attach my Bungee Gum to your cheek?
When did he attach his Gum?
One...
When I elbowed you.
Two...
When I landed a clean hit.
Three...
When I landed a critical strike?
When was it?
Three! When you hit me with both hands!
Wrong!
The answer is four.
When I was giving you my
aura personality analysis.
That's dirty!
Damn.
If I had been using Gyo from the beginning...
Now, I have a warning for you.
Had you been using Gyo,
you would have been able to notice my aura,
and you could have avoided it
during my aura personality analysis.
However, what about situations
one, two, and three?
Have you figured it out?
I could have also attached my Bungee Gum
while directly attacking you.
You only need to conceal your aura when you
wish to catch your opponent off guard.
Normally, you use your aura while attacking.
It doesn't matter if your
opponent sees your aura
when you're landing attacks.
He's right.
If I can't dodge Hisoka's attacks,
using Gyo to see his aura won't help!
This is bad.
His power's far more difficult to
handle than I expected!
So you have to dodge all of Hisoka's attacks
if you want to avoid his Bungee Gum.
But if you're able to defend...
No, defending won't work.
Even if you block, he can still attach
his aura to the part you block with.
I can't escape.
What should I do?
Okay, that's enough talk.
Let us prepare for battle.
Resume.
If I can't escape,
I'll go to him!
Gon...
Gon!
Good...
You're so good.
Those eyes.
That look.
That spirit...
I can't wait
to break you.
But not yet...
More...
More!
Until I can no longer bear to ruin you.
Rush! Rush! Rush! Rush!
Once you've matured...
Rush! Rush! Rush! Rush!
Until you've reached soaring new heights...
I must wait.
A vicious rush!
Oh, not again!
Hisoka draws Gon into another
punch from his left fist!
Good.
I managed to block that!
I'm getting used to being dragged
around by his Bungee Gum.
This isn't over.
It's not over yet!
I'm scared...
But if I let my fear overcome me,
I'll never be able to beat anyone else!
Critical for both sides!
Plus two points!
Plus a knockdown for Hisoka!
What?
Total scores are now 9 points for Hisoka,
and 4 points for Gon!
I was never knocked down!
I got right back up!
I even blocked his attack!
What?
Something's wrong with this ref!
Are you blind?
Oh, we have another strange call.
In response to the ref's decision,
the crowd has filled the arena with boos.
Fight!
If he gets ten points, I lose.
I only have one point left.
He doesn't need to knock me down.
If I get hit by any attack, it's over!
You must be more vigilant, Gon.
Look to the right.
Oh, sorry.
I meant my right.
Down, and clean hit!
Plus two points.
11-4.
The winner, by, TKO, is...
Hisoka!
Huh?
While you were complaining to the referee,
I sent the aura on my left hand to the stone.
Total scores are now 9 points for Hisoka,
and 4 points for Gon!
Then I immediately activated Bungee Gum.
So...
It's really over?
You've made incredible progress.
But you lack experience.
About ten more fights, and you
should stand a better chance.
If we're in Heavens Arena, at least.
Therefore,
I will not fight you here again.
Next time,
we'll fight in the real world,
without any rules to restrain us.
With our lives on the line.
He's so far away...
But he's not out of reach.
I need more training in Nen...
To find a power that's as strong as Hisoka's!
With this victory, Hisoka has
earned his tenth win
and the right to challenge a Floor Master!
Gon has fought bravely, and we wish
him the best in his next match.
So that's all for now.
This is your commentator, Cocco, signing off!
A referee is supposed to be completely impartial.
But given today's matchup,
I thought it prudent
to end the fight as quickly as possible,
even if it meant lowering my standards.
So he's a technical ref.
What does that mean?
If a ref believes that a
fight may get dangerous,
he'll award points like crazy, to finish it quickly.
You have to take that into
consideration when placing a bet.
Man, I was certain that Hisoka would win 10-0...
I have nothing to say to you
about the fight with Hisoka.
You were the one fighting him,
so I'm sure you understand best of all.
Understand what?
What he learned from that fight.
Yes!
Gon, what did you learn?
A secret.
Gon-kun, Killua-kun...
You will need to master
your own styles of Nen,
as you continue down your chosen paths.
Yes!
Yeah.
I'm glad I was able to meet you.
You've set a worthy mark for me to surpass!
You think you can pass us?
One day, for sure!
Won't happen.
I can't wait to see you do it, Zushi.
Osu!
Well, let's go.
Yeah.
Thank you for everything, Wing-san!
Yeah, same here.
Thank you.
Take care, you two.
Zushi, until we meet again!
Osu!
Well, you finally accomplished
your objective, right?
Uh-huh.
Then we don't have any more business here.
Gon, what are you going to do?
Go back to Whale Island.
Whale Island?
Uh-huh.
I was able to return the favor to Hisoka,
so I want to go back to the island,
and show Mito-san my license.
It's been over half a year since I left...
I guess I'll come with you.
Huh?
I'd like to meet Mito-san.
Really?
Then let's go together.
Yeah, I'll just tag along.
Bye-bye, Heavens Arena.
Gon was able to land a punch on Hisoka
and return the tag, as he'd promised.
Despite losing the fight,
Gon was satisfied after meeting his goal.
Brush Your Teeth.

Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
Today, we introduce...
Gon!
Gon learned that he still
has a ways to go,
Me?
Gon became my first friend,
after we met during the Hunter Exam.
but he also met his goal of
repaying an old debt.
He's fun to be around because
his expressions are always changing,
He's intent on getting stronger.
and you can't ever tell what he's thinking.
Next time: Ging x And x Gon!
Hey, Killua, wanna come to my place?
I-I-I can't do much,
but thank you for letting me stay!
You're stuttering.
﻿He's so far away...
But he's not out of reach.
I need more training in Nen...
To find a power that's as strong as Hisoka's!
Mito-san!
Mito-san!
Mito-san!
Gon...
Gon!
Mito-san!
I'm home, Mito-san.
Welcome home, Gon.
You must be Killua, right?
Ging x And x Gon
Sheesh,
you should have let me know
you were coming home.
I didn't have time to prepare anything.
It's not a big deal, whatever is fine.
What are you saying?
Your friend came all the
way out here to visit.
No, it's okay.
Honestly, you should have
said something first...
Are you listening to me?
Oh, that's right...
Take a bath while I make
something to eat.
And put out your dirty clothes.
I'll be doing laundry.
Okay, later.
Now!
You have ten seconds!
One.
Two.
Three.
Is she always like this?
Four.
Five.
Pretty much.
Six.
Let's move fast!
Seven.
Eight.
Nine.
Yeah, this is the life...
Okay, let's eat.
Wow!
This looks delicious.
What are you doing?
Offering our thanks.
What does that mean?
All right...
Let's dig in.
Please help yourself, Killua.
Right.
Oh, right, Mito-san.
Look!
This is a Hunter License.
Hmm...
It looks pretty normal.
There.
Hey, what are you doing?
Just kidding...
I would never do anything like that.
Man, what if it doesn't work anymore?
Mito-san, I'm going to show
Killua around the island.
Won't that take a while?
Want me to pack some food for you?
That's okay!
We'll find something to eat in the forest.
Gon and his friend are rather late.
It's been a while since he
was last on this island.
And he's brought his first friend along.
I'm sure they won't be back until it's late.
You're right...
Maybe I should take some
food out to them.
Hey, Gon.
What are you going to do now?
For now, I'll rest up here
while I gather information...
The information I'll need before I go
to Yorknew to look for my dad.
Oh...
What should I do?
Huh?
You should stay here and then
go to Yorknew with me!
Yeah, I'm coming with you.
That wasn't what I meant.
I was thinking you're sort of admirable.
There's nothing I really want to do...
I don't really have anything
I want to do like you do.
Though there are plenty of
things I don't want to do.
I don't want to stay in that house...
Or inherit the family business.
I guess I'm a little jealous.
Killua...
I think it's fun to be with you.
Wh-What's that about?
Whale Island
is a place for fishermen to stay
during extended outings.
There aren't too many native residents.
There's one other kid here that's
around my age, and she's a girl.
So you're my first friend who's the same age.
My situation was similar...
Stuck in that house all day.
I spent all my time learning how to kill.
You were my first friend.
Do you have fun when we're together?
I guess, yeah.
Then let's stick together!
We can travel around and
see the world together!
Don't you ever feel embarrassed
saying that stuff?
I'll be looking for my dad.
You'll be looking for what you want to do.
It'll be a blast!
Yeah.
Doesn't sound too bad.
Okay!
I'll help you look for your dad until
I discover what I want to do!
Okay!
Oh, what's your mom doing?
It's hard asking about my dad,
but asking about my mom is even harder.
Since Mito-san raised me by herself,
it would feel wrong to ask her that...
Is that how it works?
At first, Mito-san told me
my parents died in a traffic accident.
She was worried that I
might end up like my dad
if I learned he was alive and a Hunter...
And she was right.
When I found out about my dad,
I kind of figured that my
mom was probably dead.
That's pretty harsh!
So I've always thought of Mito-san as my mom.
She's the only mom I have.
So there's nothing for me to ask.
I don't need to.
I see.
Man,
I wish I had a mom like Mito-san...
She's the best!
Though she does nag a lot.
That's nothing...
My mom starts crying the second
I say I want to go outside!
She actually goes into hysterics!
Say...
What?
How long will you be staying?
Maybe a month?
After that...
I'm going to look for my dad.
What's this?
Something Ging left with me.
Huh?
He asked me to give this to you
when you became a Hunter.
My dad left this for me...
I'll tell you
everything I know about Ging.
Ging is my cousin.
My oldest memory of him is of his back.
I was always running after him.
I think back then, I was three...
I have the feeling that I was
always looking at his back.
At age twelve, Ging left the
island to take the Hunter Exam,
just like you did.
He suddenly said that
he was leaving the island.
When I asked him why, he told me this...
"There's something that I want."
He never told me what it
was that he wanted.
We argued...
Actually, it was just me making a fuss.
But I never got to see Ging again
before he left the island.
You were originally told
that your parents died in a
traffic accident, right?
That was what happened to Mito's parents.
It happened right after Ging left the island.
After that,
Ging's father went missing on a fishing trip.
Both of my sons ended up passing away.
Yes...
All that happened after he left.
Ten years later, Ging returned to the island.
When he returned, he came carrying you,
and you were still a baby.
He just popped up, out of nowhere.
And he asked us to take care of you.
When I asked about your mother,
he'd only say that they were separated.
I was about to agree to look after you,
when I heard a loud,
"Don't be silly!"
I imagine everyone on the island heard it.
Grandma, you don't need to mention that!
Anyhow, I knew we couldn't
count on him to raise you.
So we don't know anything
about your mother.
Mito even yelled,
"Don't you ever come back!"
while she cried...
Grandma!
Anyway, Ging left this with us then.
This girl's tried to throw it away
so many times...
That's because you always
put it back where it was!
If you wanted to get rid of it,
you should have buried or burned it,
rather than tossing it in the trash can.
Do you understand?
That's it.
That's all I know about Ging.
Ging...
Ging, huh?
Ging... Ging...
Yeah, I'll use that.
Hey, Mito-san...
Tell me more about
what Ging was like when he was little!
Huh?
Does it sound weird for me
to use his name?
Somehow, it feels more natural.
No, that isn't it.
You want to hear what Ging
was like as a child?
Yeah!
Hey, did Ging have any friends his age?
No, he didn't.
Ging and I were the only children around.
So I always wanted him to play with me,
but he would always run off.
You were always getting lost.
Honestly, you only remember
the embarrassing stuff!
You followed Ging into the mountains,
but then you didn't come back.
When Ging returned by himself,
the whole village panicked.
And that happened several times.
But when we went to look
for you in the mountains,
Ging was always the first to find you.
No matter where you hid...
After a few times,
people started wondering if you
two were just playing pranks.
What?!
I would never do that!
Well, you always hid in places
that were impossible to locate.
It was like you didn't want to be found.
Really?
I guess so...
Oh, that reminds me of this other time.
Ging and I were...
Oh?
I see.
So this is the box.
Huh?
How do you open it?
Yeah, I tried a bunch of methods,
but it wouldn't open.
Mind if I use force?
Go ahead.
Okay...
It's no use.
This is no ordinary box.
I should be able to twist
open an ordinary steel box.
And since we don't know what's inside,
we can't break the box.
It's not making a sound.
Your dad said
to give this to you once you
became a Hunter, right?
Yeah, that's what I heard.
Once you became a Hunter...
I get it...
I figured it out!
Gon, there's one thing we haven't tried yet!
Huh?
Something you have as a Hunter
that you didn't have before.
Oh, I know!
My Hunter License!
But there isn't an opening for the card...
No, that isn't it.
I meant Nen...
There's another box inside.
These are just steel plates.
It appears nothing was connecting them.
What's wrong?
Doesn't that design
look familiar?
This is...
I know!
This is like the pattern on the promise
thread Wing-san gave me.
Wasn't that designed
to snap if Nen was used?
I bet this pattern holds a
power similar to Nen.
Maybe we're supposed
to put the card in here now.
It worked!
Bingo!
A ring
and a cassette tape...
And a memory card?
Look.
That pattern is on the back of this ring.
You should take care before you put it on.
Really?
You think that Ging
might try to hurt me?
Just to be safe.
Well, we can start by listening to the tape.
I guess.
Oh, can you copy it?
Sure, why?
Just to be safe.
Yo, Gon...
So you became a Hunter, too.
Anyway, I have a question for you.
Do you want to see me?
It was the first time Gon had
heard his father's voice.
Ging appeared
to have read Gon's mind
when he recorded his question.

I wish I had a mom like Mito-san...
Ging's cousin and
childhood friend.
She's the best,
though she nags a lot!
Next Time: Reply x From x Dad!
Earthquake, thunderstorm, fire, or Dad.
Which one scares you most?
Mito-san.
﻿Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
The word "unknown" holds magic.
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.
They are known...
...as Hunters!
What's this?
Something Ging left with me.
Huh?
He asked me to give this to you
when you became a Hunter.
My dad left this for me...
Reply x From x Dad
The box that had been sealed with Nen
contained three mysterious items.
One of them, an old cassette tape,
gave Gon his first chance
to hear his father's voice.
Yo, Gon...
So you became a Hunter, too.
This is my dad's voice.
Anyway, I have a question for you.
Do you want to see me?
If you do, keep on listening.
If you don't, press the stop button.
I'm guessing that's a "yes."
Then I'll ask you once more.
Are you prepared?
Hunters are selfish creatures.
They're willing to sacrifice
anything to get what they want.
If you're only slightly interested in seeing me,
you should stop the tape now.
I'll give you a minute to consider it.
Well?
I guess you really do want to see me.
But I don't want to see you.
I don't know how I could face you now.
After all, I chose my own desires
over my parental duty.
I'm a bad person.
I'm guessing that by the time
you hear this tape,
at least ten years will have passed.
But one thing still hasn't changed.
I'm still me.
Bo!
As you listen to this tape,
I'm off doing reckless things.
If you want to see me, find me.
But as I said before, I don't want to see you.
If I sense you nearby,
I'll make myself scarce.
Catch me if you can.
You are a Hunter, aren't you?
Your dad isn't gonna be easy to track.
Oh, wait...
Ging's still there.
Oh, I forgot to mention something...
It's about your mother.
If you want to know more, keep listening.
If you're not interested...
Are you sure?
Yeah.
But he might have left you a clue.
I doubt it.
That's what my gut tells me.
Besides, I already told you...
My mom is Mito-san.
I see.
Are you hungry?
I'll go grab something.
Yeah.
Hey, Gon!
The tape started moving
all by itself!
What?!
There's aura around the tape player!
It's Nen...
Nen is rewinding the cassette!
Nen ?
Is he nearby?
No, he infused this player with
Nen over ten years ago!
So it would start rewinding,
once it was stopped!
Why?
Beats me.
Now it's recording!
I get it! He's erasing his message!
What?
It's not working!
I can't stop it...
Damn!
It still won't stop!
I pulled the plug!
Sorry, Gon.
I'll have to break it!
Damn!
No good!
There's Nen protecting the player!
It's finished.
Now it's recording!
I get it! He's erasing his message!
What?
The other tape was also wiped.
Why would he go to all this trouble?
I'm guessing he didn't want to leave any clues.
Clues?
You can extract a lot of information
from an audio clip.
Really?
You can determine the
speaker's height, weight,
gender, age, facial features, chronic diseases,
and state of mind.
From the background noise,
you can also determine the location.
But he was more worried
about something else.
Something else?
Nen.
I wouldn't be surprised if
there were a Nen user
somewhere who could analyze
data better than a machine.
Someone who would
know everything about a person
just from hearing their voice.
Oh, I get it.
Your dad's a tough nut.
Since the tape's useless now,
we only have two clues left...
The ring and the memory card.
I doubt the ring will help,
but the memory card could be important.
Yeah, it's smaller than a normal memory card.
Maybe you need a special machine to use it?
Huh? You can't tell?
This memory card only works with the JS.
The JS?
A gaming console called the JoyStation.
It's three generations old.
You don't know anything, do you?
If this island still has tape players,
it probably has a console.
Is there a toy store here?
Yeah, there is.
Okay, hold on.
Oh, where are you going?
The toy store.
It's outside the port!
Got it!
Have a safe trip!
So this is a JoyStation...
This brings back memories.
I used to play with these all the time.
There were a bunch of hidden
gems for this console.
Then is this memory card
one of those hidden gems?
I don't see a title anywhere.
You've never played any video games, have you?
That's unusual.
Really?
That isn't a game disc.
It holds a game's memory data.
So you can't use it to play.
Yeah, you're supposed to
put the disc in here.
But if you insert the memory card and
power it on without a game inside,
you can see which games are using that memory.
Oh, really...
It looks like there's only one game saved on it.
It's called Greed Island.
Greed Island?
Anyway, there are a bunch of saves.
I doubt it will do any good,
but I'll copy the data just in case.
Copying Greed Island.
Okay.
What are you doing?
Searching on-line.
We know the game's name.
So I'm looking for a store that sells it.
0 Matches
What?
Not a single match?
Does that mean it's out of print?
There aren't any used copies...
An out-of-print game would still have
some used copies floating around.
It's possible that this game isn't for sale.
What do you mean?
It could be an indie game
that was never for sale or was
banned for some reason.
Anyway, I'll keep searching.
There we go.
This game was sold through
legitimate channels.
"Greed Island.
A hunting game for Hunters."
For Hunters?
And what's with that price tag?!
Five hundred, eighty million?
It's five billion, eight hundred million!
Huh?
That's ridiculous!
Only a hundred copies were produced.
That isn't very many.
It's practically nothing!
The developers were cocky...
The number is way too low!
But it makes sense.
The price is ridiculous,
but Hunters can afford it.
That explains how they sold out.
Do the makers have any left in stock?
Yeah, I guess we could ask.
The game you are inquiring about
is no longer in stock.
Unfortunately, there are no plans
to print additional copies.
I see, thanks.
That's a no-go.
I guess we'll have to find someone with
a copy and ask them to let us have it.
Yeah, our best bet is to advertise
on a reverse auction website
and wait for someone to offer to sell us a copy.
But where will we get the money?
If we pool our money from the arena,
that's eight hundred million.
Then we need another five billion...
Not necessarily.
Huh?
With these private deals,
the seller holds all the power.
Typically, they'll ask for more
than the original price.
So it'll cost even more?
Maybe.
Well, we can post a want ad, just in case.
Yeah, but I doubt anyone will click it.
"Looking for the game Greed Island...
Price negotiable."
Wh-What?
We already have over ten thousand hits!
So that's it...
They're trying to foist counterfeits off on us.
That should have been obvious,
considering the price.
This plan is a wash.
We can't examine every single offer.
Besides, we can't even tell
if it's the real game.
Then what should we do?
If we dig more deeply on-line,
we might uncover more information.
But I'm not too familiar with that stuff.
Is there anyone who knows a bunch
about games and the Net?
Oh, there's someone who
knows a lot about both.
Huh?
He might even own a copy of Greed Island.
What? Really?
But I don't want to ask him...
Who is it?
Oh, Gotoh?
It's Killua.
Gotoh-san?
Yeah, I'm doing fine.
Right now?
Who cares where I am?
If I tell you, my mother might find out.
Anyway, put Piggy on.
Piggy?
What?
Killua wants to talk to me?
Screw that!
Tell him I'm not here.
Don't lie!
He never goes outside!
Tell him if he doesn't answer
the phone in ten seconds,
I'll break all his figures!
Fine, put him on.
Hey, Kil...
If you lay a finger on my
collection, I'll kill you!
I was just kidding, Bro.
You don't have to get so mad.
Bro?
Well? What is it?
I'm busy here.
Greed Island ?
Yeah, I've heard of it.
I never expected you to ask me
about a super-rare game.
You don't own a copy?
No, I don't.
I wanted one, but I was five
when the game went on sale.
So I didn't have any money.
There were over twenty thousand
requests for a hundred copies.
Even though each copy cost five billion,
eight hundred million Jenny in cash.
I tried looking around later,
but I couldn't even find an owner.
It's a legendary game for all kinds of reasons.
So what's up?
Are you looking for a copy?
Pretty much.
It's impossible.
Forget it.
Even I had to give up.
Oh?
You gave up because it was
beyond your ability?
That was in the past.
I have a lead now.
But considering the amount
of effort and money,
it's not worth it.
Ah, so tell me this lead you have.
What? I won't tell you for free.
Will you trade for a Greed Island memory card?
What do you mean?
I happened to get my hands
on a memory card.
You can probably decipher the data
and recreate the game, right?
Are you telling the truth?
I don't lie when I make deals.
Okay, I have two leads.
Hold on...
Don't say anything over the phone!
Don't worry.
This information
won't help anyone who
might be eavesdropping.
The first lead is...
Yeah.
Yeah, I see.
Okay, got it.
I'll send you the memory card
through the usual method.
Sorry.
I ended up trading the copy
of the memory card.
Sure, that's fine.
It's just a copy.
In return, I got two pieces
of solid information.
First, there's a website for Hunters,
only accessible by Hunters.
We can probably find leads
on Greed Island there.
Really?
I'll have to use my Hunter License.
Stupid!
If you use your home computer,
they'll know your address!
You'll have bad guys who want your
license showing up on the island!
Oh, that's right...
You have to use public computers
for this stuff...
In a hotel or a Net café.
Well, I still don't know the address.
My brother promised to tell me,
once he's received the memory card.
The second lead is the auction
in Yorknew City.
What?
Isn't Yorknew City...
Yes, the place where we're supposed
to meet Kurapika and Leorio.
In September, the city will host
the world's greatest auction.
My brother said it's probably a hoax,
but there's a rumor
that someone will distribute
dozens of copies at the auction.
Maybe that someone is Ging.
Yeah, that theory makes the
rumor more credible.
We'll need a crazy amount of
money to buy a copy.
That's right...
I guess it really was our destiny
to go to Yorknew City.
Battera, the tycoon, is offering
seventeen billion for the game,
and fifty billion for a memory card
with a complete saved game.
This is truly legendary.
Amusing.
I'm going to end this legend...
Wow...
There's so much food!
Is something special happening?
You won't be back for a while, right?
Mito-san...
Who knows when your next
chance to eat will be?
Fill up now.
Yeah!
Let's eat!
Mito-san!
I'm going to find Ging!
After I've met Ging, I'll return to the island.
Take care of yourself until then!
Ging told Gon to find him,
leaving behind a riddle.
In order to solve that riddle
and meet his father,
Gon leaves his home again and heads
to Yorknew City with Killua.

﻿There are six distinct categories of Nen users.
Enhancer.
Enhancers are able to strengthen
various objects' effectiveness.
Transmuter.
Transmuters can use their aura
to alter objects' qualities.
Conjurer.
Somewhat akin to Transmuters,
Conjurers are able to manifest their aura.
Emitter.
Emitters can propel their
aura like projectiles.
Manipulator.
Manipulators can use their auras to
control objects and creatures.
Specialist.
Specialists are those with rare abilities
that don't fit in the other five classes.
Begin by determining which
category your aura falls within.
That is the first step to
becoming a skilled Nen user.
Mito-san!
I'm going to find Ging!
After I've met Ging, I'll return to the island.
Take care of yourself until then!
Wish x And x Promise
As Gon and Killua depart from Whale Island,
Kurapika was also preparing
to begin his journey.
You remember me?
Sure, we don't get many visitors here.
Since you were here, only one
other person has dropped by.
This place is much harder
to find than you realize.
You found the agency on your own,
so you must be pretty sharp.
But I can't recommend you to
one of our valued clients.
I have no problem with your lack of experience.
Some clients don't mind greenhorns.
But it isn't experience alone that you lack.
What do you mean?
I said that I have a Hunter License!
But your exam hasn't ended yet.
I can tell.
What?
You can't see a thing, right?
Once you've learned to see,
return.
You can't see it, but you can sense it.
Why did you do that?!
This?
Well, I was just playing with you.
Fate had a hand in crossing our paths.
Consider this advice from a veteran...
You didn't notice when I stole this,
and you didn't notice when I walked past you.
Bastard...
Return my Hunter License!
Can a newbie who knows nothing
of Nen defeat me?
Nen?
Wanna give it a try?
Understand now?
You still lack something.
Come with me.
I'll be your teacher.
The real exam has only just begun.
Today, we'll determine which
class your aura falls within.
There's something forming in the water...
You're a Conjurer.
A Conjurer...
A type that specializes in
manifesting their auras.
I see...
Ideally, I would have liked to
have been an Enhancer.
Can't do anything about
what you're born with.
You can still learn Enhancer techniques.
I'll spend the day expounding in further detail.
Let's say you have a 100% chance
of mastering Conjurer techniques.
From that,
these are your odds of learning
the other techniques.
Enhancer 60%
Transmuter 80%
Conjurer 100%
Emitter 40%
Manipulator 60%
Specialist 0%
Hatsu
It doesn't matter if you're a quick study,
you can never completely
master a different category.
The further a category is, the less likely
you are to learn its techniques.
Why is Specialist 0%?
Specialist is a unique category.
You can't learn Specialist techniques.
These are very distinct abilities
that are genetic or naturally acquired by
growing up under extreme conditions.
So why is it in this specific position?
Because the adjacent categories,
Conjurer and Manipulator,
have the highest chance of
becoming Specialists later on.
In that respect, your chances
are better than most.
Remember what you said earlier?
I...
I need...
enough power to fight on my own!
You are correct
to assume that the fastest means to your
goal would be via Enhancer abilities.
The Enhancer category
is the most efficacious
for bolstering offensive,
defensive, and healing capabilities.
However, as a Conjurer,
you can only learn Enhancer techniques
at about half of their original potency.
When you attempt to use an ability beyond
your capacity, this creates strain,
which can weaken you,
possibly fatally.
In order to consistently come out
on top, you need a stable power.
Will the stable power gained through
mastery of Conjurer techniques
put me on equal footing
with master Enhancers?
The brief answer is that it would be difficult.
Enhancers employ strong offensive
and defensive abilities.
Conjurers usually suffer from an
inclination toward one or the other.
On the other hand, this makes them incredibly
strong under the correct circumstances.
Pop quiz time.
Is it possible to conjure a sword
that can cut through anything?
That is impossible.
Why?
Because that exceeds the
bounds of human ability.
Exactly.
Even if you completely master
Conjurer techniques,
you will still be unable to
conjure some objects.
You could conjure a sharp, sturdy sword.
However, it would make more
sense to just buy a good sword.
Because it wouldn't require
any additional training.
Though with Nen, you can easily make
the sword appear and disappear.
So conjured weapons aren't as effective
as their physical counterparts,
but you can't conjure anything omnipotent.
You will need to reflect on what
it is that you wish to conjure.
Failure is not acceptable.
Because you will need an incredible amount
of focus, imagination, and training
to conjure a single object.
This is a surprise.
Learning Nen only took you half a year?
So, what kind of employer are you seeking?
I have some information for you
regarding the spider.
I shall await you in Yorknew City,
on September 1st.
I'm looking for someone who has a lot of
influence on the Yorknew auction.
The nature of the job itself is irrelevant.
The Yorknew City auction...
Employers with a lot of influence
generally post the more difficult jobs.
I doubt any of them will hire a
Hunter with zero experience.
I see three of them...
Three employers who will decide based on
the interview, rather than your record.
And they're only looking for bodyguards.
I'll give you descriptions,
so make your choice.
The first one is a gun fanatic.
Specifically, he's looking for a Midget Corp.
Golsnake 55, Limited Edition, Series #001.
The second one is a collector of fine china.
Wants Lord Corp. commemorative
plates from 1655 and 1657...
The third one collects human trophies.
Skin covered in snaking dragon tattoos,
jellied infant skulls, etc.
A fascinating hobby.
Well, take your pick.
Chains?
Yes, when I heard about conjuring,
that was the first thing that came to mind.
Chains, huh...
Why's that?
Because there's evil running
loose that needs to be
chained down to hell.
Really, now?
I have a feeling that you're
really chaining yourself down.
What do you know?
Hey! Wait up!
I'm your teacher!
I'm not finished talking!
Hold it right there!
Didn't you hear my explanation?
Conjuring ordinary chains is pointless!
And conjuring unbreakable chains is impossible!
On September 1st,
Yorknew City will host the
world's greatest auction.
That's where the spider...
Where the Phantom Troupe will appear.
What a fearsome heartbeat...
It plays a terrible melody of rage...
You want me to introduce
you to an employer
with connections to the Yorknew auction?
Yes.
Just like the last person who walked in.
Huh?
I got the same request twice today.
That's amusing.
The boy I just passed?
You know him?
What?
No.
He is interested in the auction, too...
Why is his heartbeat so full of rage?
That twerp will only make
your dinner taste worse.
We're more than willing to
take you on a date.
We'll give you the best night of your life.
Unfortunately, I am not on a date.
I'm in the middle of a job.
A job?
This is my employer.
I am his bodyguard.
Bodyguard?
That's a riot.
This babe is a bodyguard?
I'd like you to guard my body.
I don't guard ugly men.
Watch your mouth, woman!
Just shut up and...
180-Minute Love Slave
Instant Lover.
Every person I kiss becomes my slave.
Please command me, mistress!
Beat them up for me.
Yes, I would love to!
What?
Tsk, he got away.
Man, I'll have to find a new employer.
Such a splendid moon...
There he is!
Surrender!
Return the corpse samples you stole!
Don't you interrupt my work
or this splendid moon.
Enough fooling around!
Hands in the air!
Tsk, I was on the verge of
another masterful poem.
But you've ruined the moment.
"A splendid full moon
and pursuers as clumsy
as baboons could be."
Damn, that's horrible.
I know, Eliza.
If this job works out...
Yeah, don't worry.
I can take care of you
along with all of the dogs.
You don't need to worry, Eliza.
Just bear with me a little longer.
Yeah, it'll be fine.
You can count on me.
I was sent here by the agency.
My name is Kurapika.
Welcome.
Please wait in here.
I apologize for the wait.
Everyone has arrived,
so we will now explain the contract.
I'll start by stating the requirements.
I won't ask whether you have a License.
I'm only interested
in whether you can obtain the items we request.
There's one month before the auction begins.
Before then, you must find one item
from the list we will provide,
and bring it here.
These are the data cards.
Lock of hair of the famous actress Sara.
Right arm of a mummy from an Egyptian tomb.
An ichthyosis patient's scaly skin.
Skull of a one-horned creature.
The eyeballs of a Kurta.
Hmm?
What's wrong? You look pale.
Ah, Kurta eyeballs?
A-rank obtainment difficulty.
"Preserve the scarlet hue
immediately following death.
Preferably with the head included."
I've heard rumors that when Kurta
get excited, their eyes turn scarlet...
Shut up.
Not another word.
I'll say it again.
You need only find one item from the list.
If you are successful, you will be hired,
to begin training as a
bodyguard and a collector.
Best of luck, then.
I will pass this test.
First I need to curry their favor,
and win their trust.
The man talking was, most likely,
not the actual employer.
That only illustrates the distance
between the boss and me...
I shall reduce that distance to zero,
until the employer feels that he
can trust me with his secrets...
There are two things that
collectors always want.
The first is any item of extreme rarity.
The second is colleagues to whom they
can brag about their collection.
He must have connections to
other human parts collectors.
Collectors who share their
disgusting acquisitions,
a network of the lowest scum.
I'll worm my way in,
so that I can eradicate them all.
Hmm? The door won't open.
I forgot to mention one thing.
The barest minimum requirement
is that you be strong...
Strong enough to leave this mansion alive.
Kurapika pursues his quest
to avenge his brethren
and to punish the Phantom Troupe.
He prepares to step onto a new battlefield.

Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
Today, we introduce Mizuken!
He's Kurapika's teacher!
The person who taught
Kurapika Nen.
He's classified as an Emitter.
I guess Nen users are fated to meet Nen teachers.
It seems he wasn't able to
earn Kurapika's respect.
That's what happened in our case.
Fate had a hand in crossing our paths!
Next Time: Nen x Users x Unite?
Hey, Gon...
Let's go break some of Milluki's figures.
Unite for evil?
﻿There are six distinct categories of Nen users.
Enhancer.
Enhancers are able to strengthen
various objects' effectiveness.
Transmuter.
Transmuters can use their aura
to alter objects' qualities.
Conjurer.
Somewhat akin to Transmuters,
Conjurers are able to manifest their aura.
Emitter.
Emitters can propel their
aura like projectiles.
Manipulator.
Manipulators can use their auras to
control objects and creatures.
Specialist.
Specialists are those with rare abilities
that don't fit in the other five classes.
Begin by determining which
category your aura falls within.
That is the first step to
becoming a skilled Nen user.
There's one month before the auction begins.
Before then, you must find one item
from the list we will provide,
and bring it here.
If you are successful, you will be hired,
and begin training as a
bodyguard and a collector.

First I need to curry their favor,
and win their trust.
Nen x Users x Unite?
Hmm? The door won't open.
I forgot to mention one thing.
The barest minimum requirement
is that you be strong...
Strong enough to leave this mansion alive.
Dowsing Chain
The Guiding Ring Finger Chain
That's impressive.
He used a chain to catch the bullets?
Three with guns.
Six with swords.
Two more with swords above.
You guys did a good job
of concealing your presences,
but you're too weak.
I don't even need to use my Nen...
Now I understand.
So that's what's going on.
He's the one.
Stop them.
I'll give you three seconds.
One...
Two...
Okay.
I get it.
Wh-What's going on?
They really were made from Nen.
I could tell when I landed a punch,
that I was hitting aura shaped like a human...
However,
I didn't realize it was his Nen.
How did you know?
You were always careful to stand
next to others for camouflage.
But when I observed from above,
everything was clear.
You were the only person not under attack.
I realized something was wrong
when assailants appeared on the second floor.
After I jumped on the chandelier,
they just stood there, swords swinging
in a futile attempt to reach me.
I assume they received the following order:
Attack the nearest enemy.
The assailants were given
simple instructions,
so their attacks were also simple.
However, it would take a skilled Nen user
to control eleven human-sized
auras simultaneously.
A Nen user who would most
likely be a Manipulator.
Given the size of auras involved,
the Manipulator had to be
within a few meters.
Which meant that the Nen user
was inside this room.
You nailed it.
My name is Shachmono Tocino.
I'm actually a Hunter.
I work for the boss here,
so I will have seniority over you.
Now that everything's clear,
could you drop the knife?
Judging by those chains,
you must be a Manipulator...
Well, I hope you won't hold a grudge.
I was just following orders from the boss.
"Test them by trying to kill them."
But I never expected you to
pick up on me so fast.
Well, the four of you together
should be able to escape this mansion.
Good luck.
Four?
Is there another plant in the room?
I'll assume that was meant as a diversion.
But either way, it was a mistake.
I shall determine if there
are any other plants,
before we all start becoming paranoid.
There.
You are a plant.
Th-That's ridiculous!
What makes you say that?
Your chain just started swinging.
That is dowsing.
Huh? What's that?
Dowsing was originally
a technique for locating water
or metals underground.
But it was also used in divination.
I've heard of the technique being
employed as a lie detector.
That still doesn't
provide concrete proof that I'm a plant.
He's probably right.
Your heart began to pound as
soon as he pointed at you.
If you were innocent,
your heart rate would have slowly increased,
due to the stress of being wrongly accused.
But your heartbeat immediately sped up,
before gradually slowing down.
The typical melody of a liar...
Coming from both of you.
I'm convinced.
Both of them accuse you.
That's two of the remaining five.
Wait! Hold on!
That doesn't make it true.
It's possible
that three out of five are
applicants and two are fakes.
I can confirm
that he is not a plant.
Excuse me?
I think you meant "she," not "he."
And it appears that you
are not a plant, either.
My point is that we can't trust you!
You two could be working together.
A-Anyway, this is a waste of time.
We won't get anywhere by standing around.
No other choice, then.
I will have to settle this
matter on my own.
"Everything that comes
into contact with my fist
will completely burn."
Huh?
This is my special power...
Great Haikuist!
Great Haikuist
Wandering Haiku Poet
Damn it all to hell.
It didn't burn very well.
That was a failure.
That was a haiku,
the prized literary art of my homeland.
When I read a haiku, it happens.
There's your explanation.
Back to the subject at hand.
"Any person who
responds untruthfully to
my question will burn."
In other words, liars will burn in hell.
Here is my question.
Are you a plant?
No.
What about you?
I am not.
And you?
No.
Are you a plant?
Yeah, that's right.
Think carefully before you answer.
Are you a plant?
Give me your answer!
My answer is yes.
Impressive.
I'll reward you with some information.
My name is Squala.
I don't have an official license,
but I'm a Hunter with Manipulator skills.
I've used my Manipulator abilities
to instruct something to
follow a certain order.
You managed to unmask me,
but that doesn't mean you'll
be able to escape alive...
What was the something,
and what was the order?
This wouldn't be much of
a test if I just told you.
Fool.
Even if you torture me, I won't talk.
Huh?
This is my power, Instant Lover.
I am also a Manipulator.
Anyone I kiss becomes my slave.
M-M-Mistress...
Take that, and that, and that.
And that... And that!
More!
Please step on me more...
Now, answer my question!
What did you use your Nen on,
and what was your command?
Talk, quickly.
If you don't answer, I'll stop treading on you!
I'll talk! I'll talk!
I am just a l-lowly dog trainer...
That is...
A fearsome power.
I used my Nen on the dogs
that run around this mansion.
For example, the Maltese were told to nip
at a target's feet, to slow them.
That's when the St. Bernard is to use
its large body to smother the target.
At the same time, the Dobermans will rush in
and finish off the target...
If the target still escapes,
the bulldogs will—
That's enough...
Release the Nen you used on them!
A-At once!
So the dog tamer has been
reduced to a pet, huh?
Don't say that...
I only did it to make him talk.
If I wanted a man as a pet,
I'd be more picky.
That reminds me,
I never did catch your name.
I'm Basho.
As you've already seen, I'm a Conjurer.
I am Baise.
Melody.
It appears you can hear heartbeats.
What category do you fall into?
Well, I'm sure you'll find out soon enough.
Playing coy, huh?
What about you?
I'd like to know your name.
Would you tell us?
I refuse.
We do not know if we'll
be working together.
Yeah, that's true.
We cleared the first test,
escaping the mansion,
but the real test has just begun.
We must locate one of the designated items,
or we can't get the job.
If we're all interested in this job,
we're bound to run into one other again.
What is your opinion of this group?
This particular group looks promising.
More promising than him, at least.
I will not require him for a while.
Put him away for now.
I trust you can handle that, Squala.
Y-Yes...
If I find one of the objects
and earn the contract,
I will have passage to the
Yorknew City auction.
Yes, I absolutely must attend!
The Phantom Troupe will be there...
The band of thieves
that slaughtered my fellow Kurta.
Our eyes burn a deep scarlet.
Those thieves were willing to
murder to obtain those eyes,
considered one of the world's
top seven beautiful things.
I will never forgive that act.
I shall track them down
and utterly annihilate them!
Hmm, so this is Greed Island.
Looks like the memory card that
Kil found is the real deal.
You can probably decipher the data
and recreate the game, right?
You bet I can.
I'll strip down the code,
and clear the entire game.
I'll put an end to the legend,
winning fifty billion Jenny in the process.
Oh, right.
This was a trade...
I have to tell Kil the URL for
the Hunter-only website.
If I break my end of the bargain,
he might start talking about breaking
my precious figures again.
There it is, Killua.
Yeah, we're almost to Yorknew.
We'll see Kurapika and Leorio there.
I can't wait!
You're jumping the gun...
We still have two weeks before
we're supposed to meet.
Oh, you're right.
It's been six months since we
saw them, so I'm getting excited!
Six months ago, I'd never have dreamed
that we would come to Yorknew
for a reason like this.
Until we meet again.
Yeah, that'll be...
September 1st, in Yorknew City.
The auction begins on September 1st.
We'll have to gather as much information
on Greed Island as possible beforehand.
Yep, there might be information about Ging.
He left a memory card with his message.
There must be a connection.
Anyway, once I get the URL
for the Hunter website from my brother,
we can check it out.
This is it.
My brother sent the URL.
Great!
Let's get started.
Yeah!
Driven by their various goals,
Gon and Killua prepare for September 1st.
What will they discover when the
Yorknew City auction begins?
Brush Your Teeth.

Today, we introduce Melody!
She's a Music Hunter!
Has acute hearing.
She can read your state of mind by your heartbeat.

She must have incredible senses.
Hey, Killua. Did you eat my chocolate?
Female.
Nah.
Your face says you're lying.
Next time: Gathering x Of x Heroes!
Killua, I can tell fortunes.
Really?
Everyone who watched
Hunter x Hunter today is happy!
﻿This is it.
My brother sent the URL.
Great!
Let's get started.
Yeah!
Gathering x Of x Heroes
As Kurapika obtains his ticket
to face the Phantom Troupe
and avenge the Kurta,
Gon and Killua also prepare for the auction
in Yorknew City.
This is the website for Hunters?
Yeah, I've heard that Hunters
worldwide post information here.
Worldwide?
Wow...
Please swipe your Hunter License,
and enter your license code.
Put the cursor on the bartender.
What kind of information would you like?
Wow! There's so much!
Select the game category.
There it is.
Greed Island.
It will cost twenty million Jenny.
Twenty million...
So they won't give out the
information for free.
Well, we don't really have a choice.
Deposit twenty million...
I can feel aura coming from the monitor!
I guess only Nen users can enter this site.
Okay,
now listen carefully.
Greed Island is
a game created by Nen practitioners.
Apparently, there were multiple creators,
but no one knows their objective.
They put Nen into all hundred
copies of the game.
When you start the game,
the Nen activates,
pulling the player inside the game.
Inside the game?
Only Nen practitioners can play the game.
And as long as the player stays
alive within the game,
it will continue to run,
even if the console is unplugged.
It will stop if the player dies.
One person who owned the game
hired fifty Hunters to give it a shot,
but none of them ever came back.
I hear that you can return
if you find a save point.
Is that true?
This information is from
the Hunter website.
It's gotta be accurate.
At the Yorknew City auction,
seven copies of Greed Island
will be up for sale.
The lowest starting bid is 8.9 billion Jenny.
8.9 billion?!
The price has shot up!
That's 3 billion more than the retail price!
Difficulty of obtainment is G-rank.
Huh?
The game is considered a legend,
but there are plenty of copies.
If you have enough money,
it's relatively easy to procure.
Hmm, a G...
Lower than I expected.
The message is that if I can't
even get a simple game,
I'll never be able to find you,
Ging.
Still, the money is a big problem.
Hey, can we participate in the auction?
They're starting at 8.9 billion!
That's out of our league.
No, I mean by selling stuff.
Selling?
That's it!
We can look for treasure,
and then auction it off.
Okay!
We can start with the 800 million we earned
at Heavens Arena, and go from there.
Yep!
First, we'll start with online flea
markets and auction websites.
And see
what we can dig up.
We'll increase our money,
and get ourselves a copy of Greed Island !
Yeah!
Yay!
How much do we have left?
Combined, we're at 10.84 million.
Damn...
Initially, we were making a profit.
That's why I said we should only
use trustworthy public sites.
I couldn't help it!
Only the risky sites are profitable.
It isn't working...
Now, show me what you've brought.
The hair of the famous actress Sara,
and a DNA test to validate authenticity.
The right arm of an Egyptian mummy,
taken directly from a pyramid.
The scaly skin of an ichthyosis patient.
The skull of a one-horned creature.
Okay, all four of you are hired.
I'm Dalzollene, the head bodyguard.
It's a pleasure.
I'll need you to start working immediately.
Your mission is to escort the boss
to a Yorknew City hotel room.
A private aircraft will take you to
Lingon Airport, just outside Yorknew.
The trip between airport and hotel
takes approximately ninety minutes.
A special car has been prepared.
You four will provide the
outer ring of security.
Any questions?
Do you know who might
be targeting the boss?
That question isn't worth an answer.
What do you mean?
The boss is an important
figure in the underworld.
There are plenty of people with
reasons to hold a grudge.
Let me rephrase since you
didn't understand the first time.
Regardless of grudges, do you know
anyone who might actually
commit to an attack?
If we can identify a few candidates, we'll know
their motives, styles, and circumstances,
and we can prepare accordingly.
That will facilitate protecting the boss.
You said that your name is Kurapika?
You are the one who doesn't understand.
Our job is to protect the boss,
no matter who, when,
where, or how they attack.
That's all you need to know!
Don't bother building a mental profile.
If anything comes too close, it's hostile.
I'll introduce you to the boss.
Come with me.
Excuse me.
What's that?
It's a little too realistic.
Yes, that is an actual human being.
He was once a fellow bodyguard.
He ignored my advice,
and let himself be deceived
by false information,
placing not only the other bodyguards,
but the boss in danger as well.
So he was punished.
You are replacing him.
Let's go.
Boss, I've brought the new bodyguards.
Please enter.
This is the boss, Neon-sama.
Nice to meet you, everyone.
Anyway, I was pretty surprised when
we were introduced to the boss.
No kidding...
They called her an important
figure in the underworld,
so I was expecting someone intimidating,
but she turned out to be a cute little girl.
Pakunoda, how's it going?
Long time no see, Shalnark.
You, too, Phinks.
You sure took your time getting here.
Oh?
I believe I'm right on schedule.
You're supposed to arrive
ten minutes ahead of time.
Same to you guys.
Bonolenov!
Kortopi!
You guys are going with us, too?
Yo!
Haven't seen your faces in a while.
I'm here, chief.
What's our target this time?
Give us our orders!
Don't be in such a rush, Uvo.
Feitan's group won't arrive until evening.
We'll wait until everyone's here.
You have no patience.
Damn, half a day of waiting.
Oh?
Is that Shizuku?
Hello.
Has the other new addition arrived yet?
No idea...
You should ask Machi.
This is for September.
Huh? So many?
Yeah,
Rotfelli-sama and Trinc-sama
would like their fortunes told.
That just sucks.
I told you to stop increasing my workload.
I apologize.
Both of them are friendly with your father.
And what's Daddy doing?
He had to attend a meeting.
He's probably off playing golf or hunting.
Daddy? This is Neon.
What? No!
You can't fool me!
No.
No!
Huh?
Fine, you have to keep your word.
If you break another promise, I'll quit.
Yay! I get another piece of treasure!
A sweet deal.
Congratulations.
Okay...
Since that's settled, I'll get this over with.
Angelic Auto Writing
Lovely Ghostwriter
I hear she's an incredible diviner.
Thanks to her father's connections,
she's made clients of some very
important people in the underworld.
No, it's the other way around.
Other way around?
I'd say that the father has used
his daughter to increase
his standing in the underworld.
That's why he is frightened of losing her.
Afraid that his enemies
might strike back at his daughter.
Okay, all done.
Here.
Excellent work.
Say, tomorrow's auction starts at night, right?
I want to do some shopping beforehand.
Very well, I shall accompany you.
How many years has it been
since all thirteen Troupe members gathered,
Feitan?
Three years, two months.
However, two members have since changed.
#4 and #8 are now different people.
Machi, will #4,
Hisoka, actually show up today?
No idea.
Don't ask me.
Wasn't he your responsibility?
I was only supposed to tell him to come.
I don't like Hisoka.
Why does the chief let
him do as he pleases?
Because he has skills.
Skills, huh?
His Bungee Gum is quite impressive.
It would be difficult to counter.
What's your point?
Are you claiming that the
chief is afraid of Hisoka?
I won't let that statement stand.
That's not what I meant.
You're all being too generous.
He's nothing special.
Talk is cheap, as always.
Nobunaga,
this is what happens when I
keep quiet and let you yap.
You were talking as much as I was, Franklin.
And so it begins.
Ignore them.
They're just playing around again.
Anyway, why is the chief
calling everyone together?
We're thieves.
There's something he wants us to steal.
Well, I know that much.
Yes, we've arrived at the hotel.
However, one of the lady's
fortunes concerned me...
"An underground chamber
where everything costs extra.
That is where you will sleep.
Never descend stairs that
you didn't first ascend.
Do not compete with others at numbers."
There were three other poems
that begin with this verse.
Meaning that all four clients
received the same fortune.
The only thing connecting them
is that they will be attending the
underground auction this year.
So the fortune is saying that
their lives are at risk,
should they participate?
I'm assuming that "sleep" is a metaphor
for succumbing to illness or death.
I understand.
I will pass the fortunes on to the clients.
One more thing.
The lady never remembers
the fortunes she's told,
and she cannot tell her own fortune.
Does it make sense to let her
participate in the auction?
No!
Bring her back immediately!
However, I will need a proper
explanation, or she'll never listen.
If she throws a tantrum,
we won't be able to stop her.
In any case, don't take her
to the auction site.
Send some bodyguards to place bids.
I understand.
Neon...
He's not coming.
The sun's about to rise.
Damn Hisoka...
Next time I see him, I'll tear him apart.
Oh, dear...
That sounds quite gruesome.
How very scary.
Hisoka, you bastard!
You're late.
Man, I thought you weren't going to come.
You asked me to come...
Had I broken my promise,
I would never get to see
your Nen Stitches again.
Chief, everyone's here.
Chief, what are we stealing this time?
We shall take the underground
auction's treasures.
Which ones?
Ancient texts?
Because the chief likes books.
No, I'm thinking games.
There will be multiple copies of the
most expensive game ever for sale.
Wouldn't it be logical to take
precious metals and gemstones?
Everything.
We're taking everything
that's up for auction.
Are you serious, chief?
The underground auction is run by
gangs from across the world.
If we do that, we'll be making
enemies of them all...
Are you frightened, Uvogin?
I'm thrilled!
I'm shaking with excitement...
Give us the command, chief!
Right now!
You have my permission...
Kill them.
Kill every person who interferes.
Good work.
I have your next assignment.
You must win the three items on this list
at the underground auction.
Money is no object.
The complete mummy of Princess Corco.
A tissue used by the actor, Son Remarch.
Complete with DNA validation.
And...
The eyeballs of a Kurta, also known
as scarlet eyes.
Also, we've received information that
there will be an attack on the auction.
Prepare for any unexpected complications,
while focusing on the primary
objective of obtaining these items.
They're coming.
They are definitely coming!
Kurapika awaits his chance
to avenge his brethren.
The Phantom Troupe,
a band of murdering thieves.
The sun has risen on the first day
of the auction, where all sides will soon clash.
Brush Your Teeth.

Hey, Killua, are you better
at defending or attacking?
What do you think?
Hmm, attacking?
Bingo.
﻿They're coming.
They are definitely coming!
Defend x And x Attack
September 1st.
The day Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio
had chosen to reunite in Yorknew City.
On this morning, Gon and Killua
were visiting the Yorknew market.
Wow, there are so many people!
But this market's purpose
is to swindle people who
have come for the auction.
What?
This isn't the auction venue?
Obviously.
Yorknew's dream auction
is held once a year in the
world's largest auction house.
They say that, just during the
ten days of official bidding,
tens of trillions of Jenny exchange hands.
Tens of trillions?
Yeah, an item sold for ten thousand
can be turned around for a
hundred million the next day.
You can make a fortune instantly.
It's where dreams come true.
Wow...
Well, that's why a lot
of underworld auctioning
happens at the same time.
That's awesome...
Anyway, do you think Kurapika
and Leorio will show up?
They promised to meet us here.
I'm sure they'll come.
Yeah.
They might try to contact us.
Hey, you have to buy a phone!
It's standard Hunter gear.
Ah, that's true.
Hey! Welcome!
This one's great...
It's the hottest current model!
Super-thin and no bigger than a credit card.
It has GPS, which comes in
handy for meeting with people.
Don't bother.
Hmm?
That feature doesn't work in many countries,
and it isn't even waterproof.
That model is for people
who only make calls.
Leorio!
Yo!
I would recommend...
this Beetle 07.
It's a little heavy and pricey,
but it includes a translator for the
two hundred languages used worldwide.
What? Seriously?
Go with this one.
I'll buy one, too!
Yeah!
Two, please.
Two will cost four hundred thousand.
Four hundred thousand?
That's expensive, pops!
Thanks, Leorio!
But, damn, 110,580 Jenny apiece, huh?
It's a new model, so that's a
fair price in this market.
Still, talk about overkill.
I've never seen
a cell phone purchase greeted
with applause before.
But you really saved us.
Just so you know, that was nothing.
The serious dealing only starts
when the seller tells you to leave.
He's the last person you
would find at an auction.
No kidding.
So how are you guys doing?
What do you mean?
You've trained and gotten stronger, right?
What?!
You returned the tag to
Hisoka at Heavens Arena?
And you have to be pretty good
to make it to the 200s...
How strong have you gotten now?
Hey, did you learn Nen, Leorio?
Yeah, you bet.
Awesome!
Really?
Why would I lie to you?
It's the ability to build up a shroud
of aura, one's own life force...
That's Ten,
one of the four major
principles for learning Nen.
Eh? There's more to it?
Figured as much.
Greed Island ? What's that?
A legendary game.
We're trying to get a copy at the auction.
But why a game?
I think this game holds a
clue to finding my dad.
Huh?
The game holds a clue to finding your dad?
What do you mean?
Well, it's a long story.
Anyway, the problem is the cost.
How much are we talking?
The lowest starting bid is
8.9 billion Jenny.
8.9 billion?!
How much do you have?
We made some bad investments,
so we're down to 5 million.
Listen up, kids...
This event is held at Southern Piece,
the world's finest auction house.
The money you have won't
cover the entry fee.
But the game has a low difficulty rank
on the Hunter site's treasure list.
Really?
Because you only need
money to get a copy.
It always comes back to money.
This world runs on money!
Well...
That just means that a real
treasure can't be bought.
If you can't obtain an item
like this with ease,
you can't be considered
a pro Hunter, right?
I don't need you to tell me that.
But first, we need money...
We'll need some starting funds.
Let's find a way to make
some money in Yorknew!
Yeah!
A simple fool.
Leorio's probably also an Enhancer.
Damn! What's wrong?!
I created a complete
duplicate of the program.
Why aren't any events being triggered?
Did Kil somehow trick me?
No... No way.
He isn't capable of creating a fake game,
and he's not stupid enough
to lie over a deal.
Was he tricked when he
obtained this card?
I want to know the answer.
I'll do whatever it takes to
uncover this secret...
No matter how much I have to pay.
I have 12.7 billion left.
I'll need at least twice that amount
to guarantee a winning bid...
Dad, I want to make a deal.
I'll kill fifteen people,
so lend me 15 billion.
Got it.
Bye.
Autopilot engaged to Lingon Airport.
I think I was ten...
The last time I went outside.
Huh? Swap?
What does that mean?
"Swap."
An auction technique.
Slang for the exchange of goods.
Also see "Bind."
What's a bind?
"Bind."
The seller names a condition
besides money as their price.
The winning bid will be the
one that comes closest
to meeting that condition.
Condition?
No idea what that means.
So that's it...
There's another kind of auctioning...
Tonight, at 9 PM,
the mummy of Princess Corco
will be auctioned off.
Ivlenkov,
Tocino,
and Baise,
you'll handle the bidding.
Will three people be enough?
Each group of bidders
is limited to three people.
You cannot bring weapons,
recorders, or communication devices.
All on-site security is handled by
the Mafia that runs the auction,
so there's rarely any trouble.
All it takes is one wrong move
to turn every Mafia member,
worldwide, against you.
This auction is built on trust.
Which is why the Mafia don't
use security cameras.
The unspoken rule is that
any grudges and the like are left outside.
Which means
that if anything does happen,
their testimony will decide everything.
Their words are treated as gospel.
So it's imperative to make
a good impression.
Don't start any petty fights.
Avoid talking to anyone
outside this group.
What about the rest of us?
Basho and Linssen
will cover the rear entrance.
Kurapika and Melody will
take the front entrance.
Squala and I will guard the lady.
And with that,
the mission begins.
Come on down!
Let's have some
conditional auctioning fun!
Here's what's up for bid.
A diamond worth three million.
Comes with the appraisal of the
store where I just bought it.
Arm wrestling will decide the winning bid.
The first person to beat this
boy wins the diamond.
You must pay a 10,000-Jenny entry fee.
Now, let's start
the auction!
Yeah! It's mine!
I'm in!
Count me in!
Okay, don't push...
Form a line.
Adjust your strength to
match the opponent.
Every now and then,
pretend to be struggling.
Okay, you're first!
You need to pay the entry fee up front.
Here you go... 10,000 Jenny.
Thank you, step right up!
Okay, clasp hands.
Just follow my instructions.
Are you ready?
You get a single round!
Ready...
Go!
Uh-oh!
Will he do it?
You almost have it...
Hang in there!
Oh, so close!
Damn, I lost to a little kid...
Next, please.
Ready... Go!
I get it.
So this is how conditional
auctioning works.
But to reach 8.9 billion,
we're going to need 889,999 wins.
Damn...
And you lose!
Next, please.
You lose!
He's beaten a hundred and fifty people!
He's gotta be running out of steam.
He looks tired,
and he's sweating hard.
Don't lose before I get my turn!
I feel bad about tricking everyone.
I'm even breaking out in a cold sweat
at the idea of making so
much money so easily.
Okay, next person, please.
Well, we have our first
female challenger!
All right! Get him, girl!
Go easy on her, muscle boy!
How old are you?
Where are you from?
Huh? You're no fun.
Let's have a fair contest.
Oh, yes.
Ready... Go!
Oh, too bad! You lose!
Good job, girl!
Thank you very much.
Oh, you're welcome.
A pity.
That was your full strength, wasn't it?
Yeah...
I wonder who she is...
The world champion arm wrestler?
Well?
I lost.
He's strong.
That little boy?
I sort of wanted that diamond.
You should've used your left hand.
Yes, why didn't you use
your stronger hand?
Oh, right...
He extended his right hand,
so I did the same.
I'd like to challenge him again.
You can't.
No time. We have our job.
Yes.
Besides, buying and
bidding would be wrong.
We're thieves.
If we want something, we take it.
No way! I'm going!
Can you hear me?
I'm ready to give up...
Yes, her tantrumâ€”
That is, her crying exhausted her,
and she's asleep now.
I don't know what will
happen when she wakes.
I vow to obtain the items she desires,
but her goal is to participate
in the bidding personally.
So she'll be disappointed
when she wakes up and realizes
that she missed her chance.
Very well.
I'll adjust my schedule and
head over personally.
For now, just be sure to get
that mummy princess,
so we can get Neon in a good mood again.
Understood.
It's me. How's it going?
Nothing unusual.
No changes visible from the outside.
Understood.
We'll notify you if anything happens.
Still, they're being quite thorough.
Only Mafia security are allowed
within five hundred meters
of the auction house.
If they didn't do that, the surroundings
would be crawling with thugs.
They're practically announcing that
unwholesome practices are going on.
I suppose so.
Will the Phantom Troupe
really show up?
Hmm?
That's the same sound I heard earlier.
You see,
I happened to see you
leaving the Hunter agency.
When you walked past me,
your heart was playing a melody of rage.
May I ask you a question?
Yes.
Scarlet eyes.
Exactly what...
do they mean to you?
Why do you ask?
No real reason.
Curiosity?
When you saw the image
on the data card,
your heartbeat was even more fearsome.
It played a melody of boundless fury.
I suppose that I can't lie...
I am a Kurta.
Our eyes are normally brown,
but they're red when we're excited.
So I wear black contacts
to avoid discovery.
I am searching
for the eyes taken from my brethren.
I'll do whatever it takes to
return their eyes to them.
Will you report this to Dalzollene?
I will not.
I do not wish to be killed.
You could read my intention?
A heartbeat is always honest.
When you began to confess
your true nature to me,
your heartbeat was calm, but frigid.
The heartbeat of one
who is prepared to kill.
Your heart said that, though you would hold
no grudges, I was fair game if I talked.
Why did you take this job?
Why do you ask?
I'll probably lie.
I'll know if you're lying by your eyes.
I'm also a pro Hunter...
A Music Hunter, I suppose.
I'm looking for a certain musical score.
You aren't lying,
but you are concealing
something important.
Well, let's just say that you're correct.
I'm looking for the Dark Sonata.
A solo said to have been
composed by the devil.
There are four versions...
For the piano, violin, flute, and harp.
If a human plays or listens to the piece,
it's said that disaster will befall them.
Isn't that just a myth?
I doubt something like that
could exist in reality.
I've heard the flute version.
One movement alone turned me into this.
My friend who played the piece died,
their entire body like this.
That friend learned a single
movement from someone
who said never to play the music.
That day,
we were drunk and giddy.
My body was destroyed, but I
gained this ability in return.
However, I wish to restore my body.
I'm willing to do anything.
I don't want anyone else
to end up like me.
So I'll find the score and destroy it.
I chose this job because
it will be more efficient to
work from the underworld.
It's time.
The underworld auction is about to start.
It's time.
Yes.
The Phantom Troupe prepares
to bare its fangs.
How will Kurapika, now a
Nostrade Family bodyguard,
deal with them?
Brush Your Teeth.

Today, we introduce Basho!
A Hunter hired as one
of Neon's bodyguards.
Watch for his Great Haikuist technique,
which manifests any haiku he recites.
His hobby is writing haiku,
a form of poetry from his home.
I'll try one.
"This segment is a
test of the heart and soul."
Too many syllables!
Next time: A x Shocking x Tragedy.
Shocking!
Shocking?
Shocker!
﻿Tonight, at 9 PM,
the mummy of Princess Corco
will be auctioned off.
Ivlenkov,
Tocino,
and Baise,
you'll handle the bidding.
What about the rest of us?
Basho and Linssen
will cover the rear entrance.
Kurapika and Melody will
take the front entrance.
Squala and I will guard the lady.
And with that,
the mission begins.
A x Shocking x Tragedy
The Nostrade Family has
learned that someone
plans to attack the
underground auction run
by the Mafia community.
Kurapika and the other bodyguards
have begun their assignments.
Everyone's here...
These are mostly Mafia leaders.
We even have some head honchos here.
I'm surprised.
Why?
It's only an auction...
They could send an agent.
Their honor's on the line.
For each winning bid,
five percent goes back into the
Mafia community as a commission.
Does that act as a bribe?
Like, the more they bid,
the more they'll receive?
Yeah,
that's how the Mafia flexes
its financial muscles.
So this is a chance to improve
their standings.
But some gangs have gone bust
because they overbid.
It's about to start.
Okay...
Welcome, everyone.
So, I'm skipping the formalities.
Die.
My Ambidextrous Automatic Weapons
Double Machine Gun
Get down!
Black Balloons!
Guard me.
Thankless Heroes
Eleven Black Children
Is he using Nen bullets?!
That means he's also an Emitter!
He'll break through my Nen barrier,
and pierce my body...
Each bullet packs an incredible punch!
Run!
Inform the bossâ€”
Baise, you go ahead...
That was way too fast...
I didn't get to do anything.
All yours, Shizuku.
Let's go, Blinky.
Suck up the bodies, blood,
body parts, and all their possessions.
Grab the chairs, too.
Shizuku's Nen ability is always
entertaining to watch.
Oh?
Someone's still alive.
Wh-Who are you?
Doesn't matter.
You're all dead...
The community will
destroy you.
Your family!
Torture you... Cut you up.
You'll taste hell!
Family?
What's that?
I'm having difficulty hearing clearly,
but there's a real commotion
inside the building.
Something must have happened.
Contact the leader!
Got it.
I'll contact Linssen and Basho.
You two head inside!
Wha...
What?
There's no one here.
Where did they go?
Search the place!
Hey, what happened to
the merchandise?
Underground... Head underground, now!
It appears that everyone in the
auction house has disappeared.
What?
The whole place is in an uproar.
It's out of control.
What about the merchandise?
Melody is heading underground, to the safe.
I-It's empty...
The goods for today's auction
have been stolen!
Who did this?!
Damn!
Where'd they go?
Split up and search, fool!
Send word to every gang...
Quickly!
Okay, understood.
We'll catch those thieves.
I'll head over.
Rendezvous with Linssen and Basho
behind the building, in Central Park.
Squala...
Yes?
Just in case, leave five dogs behind.
Right.
Listen up!
Don't take your eyes off the boss!
Don't let anyone in the
room until we return.
Yes.
All roads are sealed.
The only remaining escape
route is by air!
If you see any suspicious
aircraft, contact me.
Make sure not to kill them.
The community has offered
a substantial reward to
the gang that captures the thieves.
You must take them alive!
There wasn't any merchandise?
No, the safe was empty.
According to the auctioneer,
the only one who knew the situation,
everything in the safe had been
moved a few hours earlier.
Exactly as though they
expected this to happen.
Don't you find the timing too perfect?
We have a...
Judas among us.
We have a Judas among us.
You're saying that one of us is a traitor?
There are no traitors.
Besides, Judas wasn't a traitor.
It's said that Judas sold Jesus out
for thirty pieces of silver.
But how much would a traitor ask
from the Mafia?
Consider the merits...
What would the traitor gain
by selling us to the Mafia?
Money?
Glory?
Prestige?
Do you truly believe
that any of us cares for those things?
It's unlikely...
You see?
Besides, something else
here doesn't add up.
Huh?
Assuming there were a spy,
the response was too tepid.
If they had foreknowledge
that Class-A bounties would
appear at the auction,
they would have increased security.
The auction goers were all
uninformed and unarmed.
That's true.
I believe that someone
provided information
that wasn't explicit.
However, a Mafia community leader
believed that information.
I don't get it...
Who told who what?
Whatever.
So what do we do?
Did you ask the auctioneer
where the merchandise was moved?
Yeah, but
he swore on his life that he didn't know.
Feitan tortured him, so he wasn't lying.
He had the worst luck of them all today.
Did you get the names of
anyone who might know?
You bet I did.
The auction is run by the
Mafia community heads,
who lead gangs in each of the
ten districts around the world.
They're called the Ten Dons.
This is the only time that all
ten gather in one place,
to discuss business and issue orders.
Their commands are carried
out by a special force,
the Shadow Beasts.
This squad consists of each
don's best combatants.
I see, then...
Since the Shadow Beasts weren't
guarding the auction house,
the Mafia didn't know we were coming.
That makes sense.
Then how did they move
the merchandise?
That's right...
I heard that a single Shadow Beasts
member turned up at the safe.
The twenty-five square-meter
safe was packed with
items ready to be auctioned off.
The Shadow Beast walked in, then
walked right back out, empty-handed.
But the safe was emptied.
It was a man in sunglasses,
calling himself Owl.
He must possess a Nen power
similar to Shizuku's.
Probably.
Surely they noticed
after five hundred people disappeared...
That they're facing Nen users.
Can we let loose?
Naturally.
Put on a show for the pursuers.
That will draw them out.
I can't wait...
Up there!
It's them! They're in a hot air balloon!
The balloon is moving toward
the Gordeau Desert!
We're in pursuit!
Hot air balloon?
Not an airship?
Then what became of the
hundreds of guests?
It's possible that we aren't dealing
with an ordinary band of armed thugs.
Contact the Ten Dons.
Ask them to immediately
dispatch the Shadow Beasts!
Hurry, they're headed for
the Gordeau Desert.
Okay!
Roger that.
Come down here!
We'll even let you decide whether
you'll be drowned or buried!
There's a whole crowd...
I don't have to suck them up, do I?
No, they don't matter.
Hey!
Stay out of this.
I'll handle it...
Wait!
Are you the ones who
kidnapped the guests?
Yeah.
Well, you do have guts.
Who's your leader?
Bastard.
His philosophy is
to be the strongest
of them all...
An ordinary gun wouldn't
even scratch him.
Physically, he's the strongest.
It's like watching a gorilla stomping ants.
Oh?
More of them.
They came all the way here,
merely to be killed.
Just watching isn't any fun.
Let's play cards.
Yes.
I agree.
Boss!
That wasn't enough to warm me
up for the Shadow Beasts.
Ow...
A rifle?
How annoying.
Trying to take me out from afar?
Yeah! Bull's-eye!
That's enough!
Don't get too cocky, monster.
This super-bazooka is strong
enough to take out a tank.
You'll be blown to smithereens!
How sad...
You're comparing me
to some little tank?
Die!
Did I get him?
That kinda hurt...
None of you will escape!
It appears the enemy can use Nen...
And he's ridiculously strong.
The advance force was obliterated.
Guns are ineffective against him.
Impossible...
See for yourself.
His aura is unbelievable.
As is the number of corpses.
Who is that guy?
He's tearing through people
like scraps of paper.
We're supposed to capture him?
I won't be part of that!
I agree.
I don't see how we can win...
Indeed.
However, we cannot abandon
our mission and back off.
But...
Wait.
I suddenly hear an additional
heartbeat coming from somewhere...
I am Worm, a Shadow Beast.
Which group do you belong to?
We're bodyguards for
the Nostrade Family.
I see.
It seems that you can use Nen,
but don't bother.
These aren't ordinary thugs.
To them, taking lives is like breathing.
Y-You could say they're
professional killers.
And a pro knows his trade best of all.
Rabid Dog.
I'm Leech.
I-I'm Porcupine.
We Shadow Beasts will see to them.
These are the Shadow Beasts...
The Mafia community has
unleashed the Shadow Beasts
on the bandits who attacked the auction.
Kurapika still has yet to
realize that they are
facing off against the Phantom Troupe.

Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle
After the Phantom Troupe's
raid on the auction,
Uvogin has single-handedly
annihilated the Mafia pursuit.
Now, they watch the arrival
of the secret weapon dispatched
by the Mafia's Ten Dons,
the Shadow Beasts.
Man...
Not one of them put up much of a fight.
Uvo!
Yeah?
Here they come.
Hey, don't interfere.
I still haven't gotten to enjoy myself.
Jeez...
Let Uvo handle it.
Care for a round, Feitan?
He's going to fight the
Shadow Beasts by himself?
The Shadow Beasts, huh?
Where did you hide the merchandise?
What happened to all the
guards and guests?
We killed them.
So where's the merchandise?
If you don't answer me...
That stung.
Now you can't escape...
Make your choice.
Do you want to die
underground, at my hands?
Or on the surface, at the
hands of the other three?
Idiot.
Here he goes.
Uvo's getting serious...
Four.
You're the one
who can't escape!
Big Bang Impact:
Fist of Destruction
I-I don't believe it!
I've never seen a Nen user
of this caliber before.
That's...
A spider tattoo.
Then he's...
Spider...
Poor chap.
Not much left of him.
Uvo's Big Bang Impact
packs a powerful punch.
Honestly...
He's just throwing a straight right,
with a little added Nen.
Eight.
Nine.
Ten.
Okay, who's dying next?
The Phantom Troupe, huh?
He sounds pretty confident.
You're the one who will die next!
Fool.
Nice...
I like reckless opponents.
But you're still going to die!
I can manipulate my body hair at will.
I can even turn it into hard spikes, yup.
You throw a strong punch,
but it's meaningless if
you can't connect, yup.
They managed to damage
Uvogin's iron skin with nothing
but body hair and teeth.
Must be skilled Nen users.
I'm impressed.
Thirteen.
No way!
Sorry.
Want a hand, Uvo?
Keep out of this!
Damn it...
It's futile.
You can't shake off thousands of spikes
once they've penetrated your skin, yup.
Then I'll use you as my fist!
Since I can manipulate it at will,
I can relax certain sections of
my body hair as necessary, yup.
We've got Muscles on the ropes.
That's bull.
You're damned tough.
Did it finally kick in?
My fangs secrete a tranquilizer
that's meant to instantly incapacitate you...
Bastard...
Everything from the neck up is unaffected,
so you can still feel pain and fear.
So sit back and enjoy.
If he were using a lethal poison,
this fight would be over.
I'm sure he likes to torture opponents.
I keep numerous leeches
of all sizes within me...
They'll enter your body
through your wounds,
and deposit their eggs in your bladder.
These spotted leeches are
a gift from me to you.
You're totally disgusting!
Most people die from the
excruciating pain
of hundreds of millions of leeches
as they hatch inside their bodies.
Yuck.
I thought that uglier usually
meant better-tasting.
Why are you surprised?
You aren't the only one
who can use his teeth.
Everything from my neck up
is all I need to defeat you.
They're going to lose...
The Shadow Beasts will lose.
They're going to lose...
The Shadow Beasts will lose.
Defeat us?
Heh.
You can't bite me when I'm
all the way over here.
A bullet?
No...
It's a fragment of Leech's
skull that he bit off!
He's going to do the same to me?
But it won't work...
My body hair will repel
any projectile, yup.
Huh?
You can't repel sound projectiles, can you?
Oh, you can't hear me anymore?
He used sound to defeat
a Shadow Beast.
They're all crazy...
You idiot!
Give us a warning first!
What if our eardrums had burst?
Sorry about that!
But that would've given my plan away.
Besides, you guys had plenty
of time to cover your ears
before the sound reached you.
That's true.
Wait, Kurapika!
What are you doing?
Shouldn't that be obvious?
I'm going to capture him.
It's impossible!
You saw what he's capable of!
You're going to get yourself killed!
Kurapika!
I really don't care.
I hear tremendous rage and hatred.
He's completely lost control.
Kurapika!
He will definitely get himself killed.
I cannot leave him in this state.
Stop, Kurapika!
Wild Flower.
The perfect song to relax you.
Has everyone calmed down?
Let's cool our heads,
and devise a plan together.
Y-Yeah...
What kind of abilities do the
other members possess?
I bet they're all ridiculously strong...
Melody...
Hmm?
Thank you.
I've cooled down now.
However, I still must capture them.
Leader,
I can make this happen.
What?
Let me go.
After witnessing that
incredible show of strength,
you still believe you can defeat him?
Of course.
I understand.
Bring the car, so we can
leave at a moment's notice.
R-Right.
Shizuku!
Would you suck the poison and
leeches from my body?
Your vacuum will do the trick.
Blinky can suck out poison,
but nothing alive.
What?
Then what am I supposed to do?
Let me see.
This is a spotted leech...
It takes one day to migrate to the bladder,
before laying its eggs and dying.
So?
The eggs will hatch shortly after,
exiting through your urinary tract.
It will cause enough pain to kill you.
Hey, don't joke around...
However, they require a specific
ammonia level to hatch.
If there isn't enough,
the eggs don't hatch, and they
can be excreted harmlessly.
So, until this time tomorrow,
you should drink beer non-stop,
and be sure to urinate frequently!
Don't scare me like that...
Shizuku, can you take care of the poison?
Yes.
Someone go to the city
and get lots of beer.
I'll go.
Make sure they're ice-cold!
Don't get too greedy!
Okay, get that poison out of me.
Huh?
Did you see that?
Yeah.
Those chains came from nowhere,
to wrap around his body.
Is it a new Shadow Beast?
Uvo can't move because of the tranquilizer,
and the leeches are still inside him.
Then that's that...
Let's go and save him.
Good grief.
He's so much trouble.
I have a trace for now.
I used In to conceal the thread.
So as long as they don't use
Gyo to spot the needle,
I can follow them anywhere.
Okay, let's find them
before they notice it.
This is our chance to finish the
remaining Shadow Beasts.
Franklin, we're counting on you
to bring back lots of beer.
Man, the chase sounds more fun...
Let's go!
Indeed.
The spiders...
We'd need all the remaining members
just to stand a chance...
Understood.
Chains...
Hey, driver...
You think these chains can hold me?
If you don't kill me now,
you'll regret it later.
Shut up.
Don't you understand?
This is a golden opportunity.
Stop wasting time, and just...
I told you to shut up!
Kurapika, watch...
Watch the road!
How can he be this strong?
Even if my body weren't paralyzed,
I'd still be having trouble...
He's put enough Nen into these chains
to keep a master Enhancer in check?
Chain Jail.
Chain Jail:
The Restraining Middle Finger
This power can only be used on the spiders...
A power to capture and
restrain the Phantom Troupe.
I've sworn to use this ability
for no other purpose.
I've applied the condition that,
should I use this technique
on one who is not a spider,
I will die on the spot.
A self-imposed restriction.
A self-imposed restriction,
and a covenant with myself.
A self-imposed restriction.
A covenant with myself.
The proof of my resolve.
Look out, Kurapika...
The risk is high.
Watch the road!
But the stronger my resolve,
the stronger my Nen!
Kurapika has captured a member
of the Phantom Troupe, his sworn enemies.
Armed with resolve and the
willingness to risk his life,
an intense battle is about to begin.

After using Chain Jail
to capture Uvogin, Kurapika
and his fellow bodyguards flee by car.
We have cars behind us.
Someone check it out.
Indeed...
Think it's them?
Kurapika, floor it!
It's a tail!
A tail?
But who?
Could it be?
A thread!
Probably made of Nen.
There's something on his left thigh.
Damn!
They noticed it.
That was faster than expected.
Don't worry.
We've almost got them!
Whatever...
Why are we all stuffed in this tiny car?
It's just a little longer.
Fun Fun Cloth:
Convenient Magic Kerchief
What the hell?
Hey!
Let me out, damn it!
You guys really are good.
Given that you were
fast enough to open the door
and escape in moments.
I'll need to take care.
Nobunaga had an unlucky position...
Anyway, you have an interesting ability.
Let me out, damn it!
You can shrink anything merely
by using that cloth?
That would be quite handy for theft.
With that thing, you could fit all
of the treasure in your pocket.
Meaning that he's the one
who took the treasure
from the auction house.
And so, you can also restore
everything to its original size.
I believe the boss said he's named Owl.
His friends have arrived to help.
Yes...
There are quite a few of them.
Who are these guys?
Are they really Phantom Troupe members?
Yeah, definitely.
But they look so weak.
One, two, three...
Huh?
What's wrong?
There are ten total Shadow Beasts, right?
Uvo took care of four,
so this should be the rest.
That is strange.
The chain user grabbed Uvo,
before escaping by car.
Does that mean the chain
user isn't a Shadow Beast?
Well, we'll know once we ask them...
Should we keep them all alive?
No, we require only Owl.
Then I'll handle that.
Those damned kids are talking smack.
Let's show them how scary the
Shadow Beasts can be.
Did you hear that?
Shalnark, you just stand
there and watch.
I'll take three.
Shizuku can have the other two.
Got it.
Don't get cocky!
Keep your cool!
Don't underestimate their strength!
Shut up!
We lost them.
But what was it that I just saw
landing on the roof of their car?
Probably one of the
remaining Shadow Beasts.
This is our chance to
hurry back to the city.
Roger that.
We'll switch the location to pattern C.
And we don't want Muscles
here putting up a fight,
so we'll need muscle relaxants
and sleeping gas.
I hope those will work...
Move, and you'll get cut.
Okay, all done.
What about the bodies?
Just leave them.
No point hiding them now.
Okay, let's free Nobunaga
before we start torturing this guy.
Hold on.
We're taking Owl in the car with us, right?
There's no room, so let's
leave Nobunaga as he is.
Screw that! Let me out!
I don't want to be cramped, either.
Come on!
Hey, can you release the car alone?
I know you can hear me!
You're really making me mad!
Th-That's impossible...
Let me out, already!
Too bad.
So much for that...
Hey! What's going on?
You bastards were
making a fool out of me!
Troupe members aren't
supposed to snap at one other.
Shut up!
Anyway, this ability could come
in handy for our job.
Shut your mouth!
I'm cutting this guy to shreds!
No.
He's going to tell us
where the treasure is...
Feitan's going to use his skill at torture.
You just have bad luck.
Damn it!
Hey, wake up!
You understand
what's happening here?
Where did you put the
stolen merchandise?
What time is it?
How long have I been asleep?
It seems that you don't grasp
your current situation.
I'm asking the questions here!
Incredible mental fortitude...
He's well aware that he's
about to be tortured,
but the aura around his
body remains firm.
That iron body is built
on a rock-solid spirit.
That is why his aura is so strong.
The product of countless battles.

Can I move?
No...
I won't recover for a while.
I had dinner around 8.
Judging by my stomach,
it's around midnight now.
Let's make a deal.
I'll spare your lives, so let me up now.
Wh-What is he saying?
Is he insane?!
He's serious.
I think.
What? Are you crazy?
He's the one who should
be begging for his life.
Let me make something clear.
We're after the auction merchandise
that was stored underground.
If you guys don't know where it is,
I have no business with you.
What?
Wait a moment.
You didn't steal the merchandise?
The safe was empty when we arrived.
The Shadow Beasts had
already taken it all.
I guess they didn't bother
telling grunts like you.
I don't think he's lying...
Then he's serious?
When he offered to make a
deal, he wasn't bluffing?
Everyone makes mistakes...
We haven't stolen anything yet.
So take these off,
and pretend you didn't see anything.
If you do that,
you get to live!
What about the guests?
Guests?
The guests who were in the auction hall.
Some of our colleagues were there.
Answer me.
I see.
That's too bad...
We killed them.
It was part of our plan—
How many lives do you think you took
to carry out that plan of yours?!
Stop, Kurapika!
Stop it!
If the merchandise is in safe hands,
we don't need him.
We'll hand him over to the community.
So, no deal?
Oh, did you find out what
became of the merchandise?
Shut up! Ask Feitan!
Did he tell you where the merchandise is?
It was no fun...
I'd barely gotten started, but he gave in.
Oh, so that's it.
Ah, I just remembered.
I was supposed to meet someone today.
I'll be heading out.
Sure, go ahead.
As long as you return by 6 PM tomorrow.
Up to some mischief, Hisoka?
But of course.
Damn...
"Let us meet at the agreed upon place."
Where's Shalnark?
He just called.
He's succeeded in locating
a Mafia comms room.
This is Dalzollene of the Nostrade Family.
We've captured one of the bandits
who attacked the auction
and wish to hand him over.
Really?
How did you manage that?
I can provide further details later.
That's impressive...
The Shadow Beasts never stood a chance.
The Shadow Beasts never stood a chance?
Yeah, they were completely wiped out.
Wiped out...
Well, where are you right now?
Okay, got it.
Move quickly.
Yeah, we'll bring our best people.
I gave him three canisters
of muscle relaxants.
Understood.
The Mafia will be here soon.
I'll watch him until then,
so get some rest, everyone.
Yeah.
You move fast.
He isn't using In.
No need for concern.
I have no interest in fighting you now...
I'm not here for idle chat!
Tell me about your organization.
Really?
I love idle chat.
There are thirteen spiders,
identifiable by their
numbered spider tattoos.
Members can change at
a moment's notice.
An applicant defeating a standing
member replaces them.
If the Troupe loses one for other reasons,
the boss selects the replacement.
The Troupe focuses primarily
on stealing and killing.
Sometimes, they perform
philanthropic work.
I already know all of that.
Two or three years ago,
I replaced the man who was #4.
For what purpose?
So that I could fight the boss.
The boss?
Why would you want that?
Because he is strong...
You wished to test your strength?
Perhaps.
But...
It turns me on...
Thinking about fighting the boss...
But I've never had the chance.
He never lowers his guard.
At a minimum, two others
always accompany him.
And when a job ends, he vanishes.
Without a trace.
So I reached a conclusion
that benefits us both.
Would you not agree that reaching
our goals alone will be difficult?
What are you trying to say?
I can tell you the Troupe members' abilities.
There are seven whose
powers I already know.
Interested...
in teaming up?
Yeah, we're on floor B2.
Thanks.
You haven't killed him yet?
No.
This way.
We couldn't get a needle into him,
so we used paralytic gas.
You clean up nicely.
Huh?
I couldn't believe my ears
when I heard you'd been kidnapped.
Blinky, time for work.
Suck out the poison paralyzing Uvo.
Okay, all done.
Damn!
I'm gonna make that chain user pay...
Wake up, everyone!
Where is he?!
He ran away.
You were too loud.
We're heading back.
Our job here is done.
We also dealt with the Shadow Beasts.
And we got our treasure.
No!
Tell the boss...
I won't go back until I settle up
with that chain user.
Uvogin has been freed.
Kurapika, invited by Hisoka to team up,
is not yet aware of this.
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit
Coming up, we have Gon
and Killua's
Hunterpedia!
It's Gon
and Killua's
Hunterpedia!
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
Today, we introduce Dalzollene.
Leads Neon's bodyguards.
He's the leader of Neon's bodyguards!
A cruel, impatient man who disposes
of any who fail to follow orders.
Must be a drag taking care of that selfish brat!
It's a drag for me, taking care of you.
What are you on about?!
Next time: Chasing x And x Waiting.
Hey, Killua,
let's play Drop the Handkerchief.
I'll drop it, and you sit and wait.
You can't play that with two people!
﻿Tell the boss...
I won't go back until I settle up
with that chain user.
Chasing x And x Waiting
Hisoka, who joined the Phantom Troupe
for a chance to fight the leader, Chrollo,
has proposed that Kurapika,
who seeks revenge
on the Troupe, join forces with him.
Well? It's your call.
Will you work with me?
Or will you fight alone?
Go ahead.
It's me.
Kurapika, it's terrible...
The man we captured has escaped.
Escaped? On his own?
No,
some Troupe members
disguised themselves as
Mafia and came for him.
What about the leader?
We've been unable to reach him.
We're heading toward pattern B.
Return immediately.
I understand.
Hisoka, I have a question for you.
Do you know what became
of the Scarlet Eyes?
Unfortunately, that was
from before I joined.
The boss sells every item after
admiring it for a while.
The Scarlet Eyes should be no exception.
That is all I know.
But keep this in mind.
A spider will not stop moving
until you crush its head.
I asked if you wanted to team up,
but I was not suggesting that
we fight side by side.
Merely that we exchange information,
in a give-and-take relationship.
If it ceases to be beneficial to either party,
there will be no further
obligation to cooperate.
Simple enough, yes?
What do you say?
I'll be here tomorrow,
at the same time.
So, what do we do now?
The leader is probably dead.
And we haven't completed the mission...
Shouldn't we report this to the boss?
That little girl's our boss in name alone.
It was someone else who hired us.
Light Nostrade, her father.
He gave the orders,
and the leader received them.
But the leader was the only one
who knew how to contact him.
It seems we have no choice but to report
what's happened to the boss.
Boss... Boss.
What time is it?
It's 2 AM.
Huh? What about the auction?!
It's been called off.
Huh?
Called off? Why?
The auction was attacked by thieves.
Huh?
Baise, Ivlenkov, and Tocino
died during the attack.
What?
We can't reach the leader,
so he's probably done for.
No way.
What about the mummy?
Was it really stolen?
I wanted it so much...
The Mafia community moved the
merchandise to a safe location.
Oh, that's great!
So when is the next auction?
We don't yet know.
What? Why not?
In any event, the leader
handled all communication,
so we don't know anything.
We cannot act until we have orders.
I don't know anything about that.
So, ask Daddy.
His number's on my phone.
Squala, make the call.
Huh? Why me?!
You're the most experienced member left.
You should be the leader.
No way!
Out of the question!
I'm not the leader type.
Perhaps we should take a vote, to be fair?
We need to make the call quickly.
I vote for Kurapika.
He was the one who
apprehended the bandit,
and he has shown excellent judgment.
I believe he would make the best leader.
No objections here.
I vote for Kurapika.
That's that...
You make the call.
I understand.
As the interim leader,
I'll call Mr. Nostrade.
This is only until we confirm
what's become of Dalzollene.
Any final decision will be
Mr. Nostrade's to make.
I never expected to get
a chance so soon...
It would be inappropriate for
me to call him directly,
so would you provide an
introduction, boss?
Sure.
Then, I'm putting him on now.
Hello?
Is it true that Dalzollene has been killed?
Yes.
I find that hard to believe.
He is a Nen user.
He's trained to withstand
ten gunshots without sustaining injury.
He was killed by a group of outlaws
known as the Phantom Troupe.
The spiders?
I had an opportunity to see them in action.
One of them stopped a
bazooka rocket with one hand.
I am Kurapika, the interim leader.
Could you please issue us our orders?
First, I'd like to hear your
opinion as interim leader.
I believe we should
get your daughter out of
Yorknew City immediately.
If anything unexpected happens,
we would be unable to protect her.
I agree with your assessment,
but my daughter also has a say.
I want to respect her wishes when possible.
My top priority is her safety.
I understand.
I'm on my way now.
I should arrive by tomorrow evening.
I shall do my best to persuade Neon.
You will be the new leader, Kurapika.
Here is your first order.
Keep an eye on Neon until I arrive.
Understood.
Your father will arrive tomorrow night.
Really?
Yay!
I'll get him to buy me lots of clothes.
You are to wait in your room until then.
What?
I want to see the casino...
Stay here with the boss.
Huh?
S-Sure...
I'll be downstairs, investigating.
Here we go!
That building you were in is owned by
a dummy corporation for
the Nostrade Family.
Can you get a list of buildings
the Nostrade Family owns in this area?
Of course!
I can also see if anyone's checked
in using the Nostrade name.
Here, I brought more beer.
Oh, thanks.
Here.
You should get a Hunter License, Uvo.
You can get all kinds of
information from this website,
as long as you have the money.
Unlike you guys, I dislike
the idea of money.
If there's something I want, I take it.
How splendid...
You are the model thief!
Here we go.
They own two other buildings.
And there are three hotels
where members are staying...
Well, this should be a short search.
Thanks.
I appreciate it.
Wh-What was that for?!
Well, I'm off, then.
What about the beer?
You guys can finish it.
Make sure you dispose of the body.
Try to make it quick.
Yeah.
Bye.
Uvo!
Huh?
Don't get careless.
Yeah.
Family members?
I'll start with them.
Look at this.
What's that?
A list of buildings owned
by the Nostrade Family?
There's a list of Family members...
I didn't know this information was available.
This website can only be
accessed by pro Hunters.
With this information,
they can locate this room.
A website for pro Hunters...
Then if one of the enemies is a pro Hunter...
We're in big trouble.
We need to take the boss
and find a different room.
Eh? In the same hotel?
It's faster and avoids needless movement.
But we cannot use fake names.
We'll have Melody or Basho register the room.
Make sure everyone,
especially the boss, stays inside.
Got it.
Don't check out of this one.
Kurapika? What about you?
I'll stay here.
Huh?
You can't mean to...
I-I don't think that's a Family member.
He's a bodyguard for the boss' daughter...
Daughter?
Yeah...
She's a strange one who
collects human body parts.
Eyeballs and organs...
Oh, and she's an incredibly
accurate fortune teller.
Fortune teller?
She has a long list of Mafia clients...
Some community elders basically worship her.
After all, our boss
made his fortune by using
his daughter's power.
Hey...
C-Cut me some slack?
I told you everything I know.
Please spare me!
Someone who can see the future...
She knew the attack would happen?
The boss was right.
There weren't any traitors.
Currently, we have a 3,000,000 diamond
and 2,400,000 Jenny in leftover cash.
And we also have the 2,750,000
Jenny from the arm wrestling.
That gives us a total of around 8,000,000.
We need to turn this into at least 9 billion,
the minimum opening bid for Greed Island...
I don't see how we can manage that
through legitimate channels.
I wouldn't call that arm wrestling legitimate.
All the challengers toward the end were
half desperate losers trying for revenge.
That's fine.
That was my goal.
Huh?
We want as many people as
possible to embellish the tale.
What do you mean?
The arm wrestling was meant as bait.
Bait?
To draw out the moles.
Moles? Why do we want moles?
Pipe down now.
I'll explain everything.
Come on down!
Let's have some
conditional auctioning fun!
We have a diamond worth 3,000,000.
The winner will be determined
through arm wrestling.
The first person to beat this
boy wins the diamond.
You must pay a 10,000-Jenny entry fee.
What? He's just a kid.
I'll give it a shot.
Don't bother.
That kid beat five hundred people yesterday.
Huh?
Over twenty ended up with broken arms.
Seriously?!
The stories are spreading nicely.
In that case...
Move.
Oh, do we have our first challenger?
No.
Huh?
I already know that my man
can't beat your kid.
I was watching yesterday.
Then what do you want?
Interested in making some real money?
Meaning?
I know where you can make big bucks
instead of the pocket change
you're getting here.
You can make hundreds...
No, thousands of times more.
Are they moles?
Yeah, looks like we landed a big fish.
Huh? Fish?
Don't you mean moles?
Stop talking.
It doesn't matter!
Here we are.
Oh! I can feel the bloodlust.
The arm wrestling competition here
accepts all comers, and it pays out.
The spectators bet on each match,
and the winner receives ten
percent of all bets placed.
We're talking billions bet on each match.
That would mean millions with each win!
You could win even more...
I'll be taking fifty percent of your
earnings as my commission.
Fifty percent? Isn't that a little high?
You can't participate
unless I enter your name.
Besides, you can bet your own money.
You'll get great odds with that kid,
and earn back your stake
a hundred times over.
That's right! I'm in!
Go, Gon!
Huh?
Well? Any other challengers?
Got one right here!
This kid's up for the challenge.
Very well.
Sorry, but the arm wrestling is canceled!
We'll be doing some
conditional auctioning now!
Why was it canceled?
U-Uh, I don't know.
To win, you must play
hide-and-seek!
Hide-and-seek?
We'll start by passing out flyers!
Examine the pictures on the flyer.
Those seven people are your targets!
Hey, that girl with glasses was...
Yep, she arm wrestled me.
Hey, are they the ones responsible
for what happened last night?
Yeah, you mean the attack on the auction?
In order to win the bid,
you must capture and deliver a target to us.
For each target brought in,
you will receive a nice sum of 2 billion Jenny!
There is no time limit.
It doesn't matter if the
target is dead or alive.
Please contact us once
you've captured one!
Two billion each?
If we catch them all, we'd have 14 billion!
It'll cost you 5 million Jenny to participate!
We're joining in, right?
Yeah...
Yeah, that's right.
I'll fax you the information.
Search the Net for information.
We'll pay for anything concrete.
We need to hurry.
There's no rush.
They won't be able to catch our targets.
Huh?
After all, the Mafia's having
trouble handling them.
What do you mean?
This conditional auction is
nothing but a bounty hunt.
In other words,
the Mafia is admitting that, alone,
it can't capture these targets.
You have a point...
They were willing to suspend
everything to track them down.
I just heard that the underground
auction was attacked last night.
The underground auction?!
Was it them?
That's why there's a
reward for their heads?
Yep, they must be nuts to
steal from the Mafia.
And we already know who would
be crazy enough for that.
The Phantom Troupe!
Oh, right...
What's Kurapika up to?
Yeah, he should be in the city,
but he hasn't made contact.
I'll call him.
He isn't answering.
Is he working?
Working?
I heard that he's been
working as a bodyguard.
Probably for some VIP...
He's trying to track down the Scarlet Eyes,
so it must be someone in the underworld.
What if he was guarding that
person at the auction house,
and got caught up in the attack?
He wouldn't have been
caught up in the attack.
If the Troupe attacked, he'd be
actively tracking them down.
It's possible that he's already
captured two or three.
I hope you're right...
Alone?
I'm impressed.
Where do you want to die?
I'll humor any requests.
I'd prefer a deserted wasteland,
with no one nearby.
Since I'll have you screaming
at the top of your lungs.
Uvogin has come to avenge his
capture and restore his pride.
And Kurapika has been waiting
for the chance to exact revenge
upon the Phantom Troupe.
Their battle is about to start.

He's a Manipulator.
He's actually dating Eliza-san, Neon's maid.

﻿Alone?

I'd prefer a deserted wasteland,

Since I'll have you screaming
at the top of your lungs.
Condition x And x Condition
Uvogin seeks to unleash
his rage upon Kurapika.
And Kurapika intends to
avenge his brethren against
the Phantom Troupe.
An inevitable battle is about to begin.
Yep, there they all go.
All of these are leech eggs?
That's disgusting...
Sorry about the wait.
I've got a question for you.
Who are you?
You're no ordinary Nen user.
I can sense a special intent
behind your Nen.
Before I can answer your question,
I need you to tell me something.
Do you remember the
people you've killed?
A little.
I can remember the people
who made an impression.
So you want revenge?
Who are you trying to avenge?
The Kurta.
Never heard of them.
A small clan, with Scarlet Eyes,
that lived in the Lukso Province.
Five years ago,
you attacked us.
Scarlet Eyes? What's that?
The name of a treasure?
Sorry, doesn't ring a bell...
But five years ago,
I was definitely a member.
When you kill a completely
innocent bystander,
what are you people thinking?
What do you feel?
Nothing at all.
Scum!
You will atone through death!
Fools like you are the reason
I never get sick of killing.
Wanna know what I enjoy most?
Denying those who come
in search of revenge!
Those chains are dangerous.
I don't know what kind
of trick he used on them,
but they hold an abnormal amount of Nen.
Which means...
Strike first to win!
Got him.
That's a surprise...
After taking that punch,
he still has the strength to attack?
But his left arm is useless now.
What?
Unscathed?
Impossible...
Considering the amount
of Nen in those chains,
he must be a Manipulator or a Conjurer...
I would guess the former.
But only an Enhancer should be
able to block my attack.
What is he?
Was that punch
the best you've got?
That wasn't even funny.
Don't worry.
That was twenty percent of my strength.
This time, I'll use half!
Here!
Damn!
Here!
Damn, he keeps darting around.
But...
I'll regret not using that
chance to chain you up?
Stop making excuses,
and give me your best shot.
You're wasting my time.
Okay, kid.
I'll give you all I've got!
That's an incredible aura.
A smoke screen?
His presence has disappeared.
He's using In!
This time, I crushed your arm.
No one can withstand
a full-strength Big Bang Impact.
But I'm impressed.
You reacted immediately.
I'm guessing you noticed the
slight shift in the smoke.
I am impressed, as well.
I didn't think you knew how to use In.
Striking the ground to
raise a smoke screen
was intended to conceal both your
physical body and your presence.
However...
I, too, can use In.
N-No way!
You can see them?
So you can use Gyo.
These chains were fortified
with a Conjurer's Nen.
Meaning I can use In to
render them invisible.
So you kept the chains out to trick us
into thinking they were real?
Precisely.
I pretended to be a Manipulator
using Nen-controlled chains,
so my enemies would only be
alert to the visible chains.
And my bluff just paid off.
While you were making empty threats,
my chains were already
wrapped around your body.
You've been captured.
Damn... But how?
He has an Enhancer's defensive power...
And the Nen in his conjured
chains is incredibly strong...
Has he fully mastered both
Enhancer and Conjurer techniques?
That's impossible.
Act
A Nen user can only fully master
their innate category.
Conjurer
Enhancer
I see you're having trouble understanding.
Let me illuminate you, before
sending you to the other side.
Those eyes...
I remember now.
There were a bunch of them,
in the middle of nowhere.
The boss really liked those eyes.
They were pretty strong!
Then, you're a survivor?
I'm getting fired up...
Let's see which is stronger,
your grudge or my power!
Bastard...
Is that all you can think about?
You'll never be able to break these chains!
Why? What's wrong?
When my eyes turn scarlet,
I become a Specialist.
What was that?
When I am a Specialist,
I wield full control over
every category of Nen.
Enhancer
Transmuter
Conjurer
Emitter
Manipulator
And this is my power...
Absolute Mastery
Emperor Time
Emperor Time!
Chains?
Yes, when I heard about conjuring,
that was the first thing that came to mind.
Chains, huh...
Why's that?
Because there's evil running
loose that needs to be
chained down to hell.
Really, now?
I get the feeling that you're
actually just chaining yourself.
What would you know?
Hey! Wait up!
I'm your teacher!
I'm not finished talking!
Hold it right there...
Didn't you hear my explanation?
Conjuring ordinary chains is pointless!
And conjuring unbreakable
chains is impossible!
Ignoring me?
Man, you're so stubborn.
It's impossible to conjure unbreakable chains.
But it's possible to conjure
something very close.
Really?!
Yeah, you only hear what you want to hear.
What do I need?
A condition and a condition.
A condition and a condition?
Yes, determine a condition...
in other words, a rule...
and swear to always follow it.
The stricter the rule, the stronger
the power it will enable.
Normally, Nen is additive.
(Attack + Nen) x Condition Difficulty
But a Nen technique with
conditions is multiplicative.
Your strength will increase exponentially.
Come up with a rule for your chains.
One that you are prepared to follow.
But let me warn you...
This technique is very volatile.
It's a double-edged sword.
If you break the rule you set,
you could lose your Nen.
My objective is to find
my brethren's Scarlet Eyes
and to capture the spiders.
I want chains that are
unbreakable by the spiders,
the Phantom Troupe.
The spiders will be my only targets.
So the rule is that you will use these
chains solely for that objective?
That's a little weak.
Don't get ahead of me.
Using the chains exclusively on
spiders is only the prerequisite.
Then what is your rule?
I'll stake my life on it!
Hey, Kurapika...
When your eyes are scarlet,
your aura spikes.
Could that mean...
Let's try water divination again!
A Specialist?
You have full control over
every other category?
That is correct.
Holy Chain: Healing Thumb
I can use enhanced self-healing
to completely recover a broken arm.
I shattered that arm,
but he healed it instantly.
There were a number of reasons why
I chose you to be my first target.
While you fought the Mafia
and the Shadow Beasts,
the other spiders stayed out of it altogether.
That told me you preferred to fight alone,
and that they trusted that
your strength would prevail.
I prefer to fight one-on-one.
That made you a perfect target.
An Enhancer who was confident
in his offense and defense.
You met every condition I
required for my first target.
Because then I could test if my Chain Jail
would be effective on the rest of the Troupe.
Chain Jail forcefully activates Zetsu
upon any Troupe member it ensnares.
It also paralyzes them.
So that's why I can't muster any aura...
Zetsu nullifies aura.
Meaning you'd need to use
physical strength alone to break these chains.
Damn!
If the Troupe member with the most
physical strength cannot break the chains,
the others will certainly be
unable to escape Chain Jail.
His forced activation of Zetsu here is bad...
Aura is the basis of all Nen.
If it's sealed off, you can't use your power.
A technique for sealing Nen...
This guy thought everything through.
It looks as though my enhanced fist
is slightly stronger than your physical brawn.
That's valuable information.
Then I can beat every Troupe member
barehanded, provided I've chained them.
Tell me everything you know.
Where are the other spiders?
Kill me.
What abilities do they have?
Kill me.
It makes me sick...
The sensation left on my hand.
The grating sound of each strike.
The smell of blood!
It all throws my senses into disarray...
How can you do these things,
yet feel and think nothing at all?!
Answer me!
Kill me.
This is your last chance.
I just placed a conditional
bond on your heart.
If you break the rule I set,
the bond will activate,
crushing your heart.
Judgment Chain:
Arbiter Little Finger
The rule is that
you must answer my question honestly.
Abide by that rule, and I shall
allow you to live a bit longer.
Where are the other spiders?!
Die, fool.
I spent too much time in that state...
It's me.
Kurapika, what's going on?
Why didn't you call?
Are you okay?
Yeah.
I'm glad to hear that...
What about on your side?
The boss is safe.
She's asleep in her room.
Right, the boss' father won't arrive
until late tonight, due to
weather complications.
I see.
I understand.
A chain user...
He's either a Manipulator or a Conjurer.
Uvogin is a dominant fighter.
But in a one-on-one fight, he is most
vulnerable to those two categories.
Many Conjurers give special powers
to the things that they create.
Some of those abilities could
render Uvo helpless.
And a Manipulator could
manipulate Uvo himself.
I should have tagged along!
Damn!
If he fails to return by dawn,
there will be a change in plans.
Shalnark senses the danger,
as Uvogin fails to return.
Their leader, Chrollo,
prepares to terminate the chain user.
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit
Coming up, we have Gon
and Killua's
Hunterpedia!
It's Gon
and Killua's
Hunterpedia!
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
Today, we introduce Uvogin.
A Phantom Troupe member.
A member of the Phantom Troupe.
He has a giant body.
A master Enhancer,
His special attack is a Nen-infused straight right,
with the Troupe's
toughest, strongest body.
Big Bang Impact!
Next Time: Very x Sharp x Eye.
So sharp, it's like a razor.
Ooh, sounds great!
﻿No good...
I've got nothing.
That two billion reward
per spider is attractive,
but finding them will be impossible.
Yeah...
Hey, we could ask for concrete
information on the Net.
Like about the Troupe's current location.
We could offer a large reward.
Hold on...
We don't have the money for that.
It'll be fine.
Very x Sharp x Eye
Gon and his friends are
pursuing the Phantom Troupe,
and have now obtained the money
to buy the information they need.
That's crazy...
You actually have money.
Man, you really pawned
your Hunter License?
You're insane.
So, what should we do first?
Let's start by purchasing
a Southernbees catalog.
Here is this year's
Southernbees auction catalog.
Thanks.
There it is!
Greed Island !
Seven total copies on sale...
The minimum starting bid is 8.9 billion.
Just as expected.
Now we wait for the
information to come in.
First, we catch one of the spiders
and make them tell us where
the rest are hiding,
so that we can bag them all!
Huh?
What's wrong, Gon?
This is...
Oh, a Ben's knife.
A Ben's knife?
A hundred years ago,
a mass murderer designed it.
He was a famous blacksmith.
This is one of his original works.
It's a lesser-known piece that a
lot of rabid collectors are after.
So, you recognized it.
No, I didn't.
Huh?
It happened to catch my eye,
so I got curious
and I used Gyo.
That's when I noticed a faint aura on it.
Gyo ?
A form of Nen.
Basically, you look really
hard at something.
You're right.
Let me have a look.
Nope, I don't see a thing.
You will, once you spend
more time training in Ren.
Right! There's another way!
Another way?
Another way to make money.
Remember how four-eyes mentioned that
really talented people use Nen without
even realizing it themselves?
Four-eyes?
Wing-san.
He taught us Nen.
If we search for items with
aura on them, like this knife,
it's likely some genius made them.
I get it!
We can find hidden gems
with no formal appraisal training.
Then we auction the items at a higher price!
If you guys want that,
write down your price.
Customers are supposed to
name their own prices?
Yeah, that's how this market works.
You write down what you're willing to pay,
and when time expires,
the highest bidder wins the item.
Understand? Popular items
will see their prices shoot up.
I get it now.
Well, then let's get started.
I'll check the online forums.
Okay!
This is a weird pot, but I detect aura...
Someone already bid!
If a bid has already been placed,
enter one that's 2.5 times higher.
Even if you end up bidding too high,
you'll succeed in discouraging any rivals.
500 multiplied by 2.5...
Let's see...
It's the same person!
Same on your side?
I found a couple items,
but both had bids already placed by "Zepile."
And after I entered a bid 2.5 times higher,
he multiplied that by 4.
Then it isn't a coincidence?
No.
What should we do?
Keep placing bids until the deadline.
There are two of us, so we'll win some!
Okay.
So ultimately, we won three and lost one.
Yeah, he got that weird pot.
Well, that wasn't too bad.
Let's take these to the auction house now.
I am very sorry.
But the auction house cannot
accept any additional items,
once the catalog has been published.
Isn't there any way?
We really want to auction these.
I suggest that you give
the trade market a try.
The trade market?
The trade market...
Professionals will be here, so if one of these
is genuine, we should get a great price.
I wanted to sell these at the auction, though.
How much do you think we'll get?
Let's find out.
Oh, you found these in your cellar?
Yep!
Dad said to sell them if the price was right.
These are wonderful pieces.
Only fifty copies were printed, and yours has
a single-digit serial number.
And an authentic autograph.
We know.
That's where the aura was coming from.
I'd guess it's worth at least 150,000.
This antique doll is also excellent...
It's in great shape,
and the pristine condition of both
box and doll raises the value.
I'm estimating 300,000.
However,
this one isn't worth much, unfortunately.
Huh?
The box and statue are
from different periods.
The box was made recently.
The statue is rough and doesn't
adhere to any theme.
I'd say it's only worth 1,500 Jenny.
But there is a little aura...
However, that would be its
appraisal as an artwork.
The wood itself is quite valuable.
So I'll make you an offer.
If you sell me the painting
and doll for 420,000,
I'll buy the wood for 80,000.
A total of 500,000?
What do you think?
Feel free to think it over.
But I doubt anyone will quote
you a better price.
In the meantime, let me
check this wood's age.
Wait!
Put down that statue.
Wh-Who are you?
Don't let him scam you, kid.
He's offering a fair price
for the painting and doll,
but he's lying about the statue!
I-I never lied!
Really?
No collector would pay
80,000 for that wood.
You're interested in
the contents of that statue!
It's a wooden trove.
A wooden trove?
Three hundred years ago,
these were a popular way for the
wealthy to hide their money.
To hide their money...
If it's real, there should be valuables inside.
You planned to steal the contents,
while pretending to check its age!
I-I would never do that...
Wait.
Can you prove that this is
a genuine wooden trove?
What?
The wood is certainly over
three hundred years old.
But that only tells us the material's age.
The statue itself could be modern.
This technique is known as hoodwinking, boys.
Technique?
He's referring to a counterfeiter trying
to trick a professional appraiser.
But that isn't what I'm doing.
Here's a seam that an amateur
would never recognize.
The seam contains an adhesive
used back in that period.
You're insisting this is a real wooden trove?
Yeah.
But it is possible that it was opened
once to swap out its contents,
and the statue was reassembled.
We'd call that a dud.
It's called double-dipping,
placing new adhesive on top
of the old to create a dud.
But only an amateur would try that.
A professional would melt
the adhesive with a flame,
before resealing it.
That way, it would appear as though
the statue had never been opened.
That's known as welding.
It hasn't been welded.
If fire were used, the wood would be scarred
or the adhesive would have discolored.
Even the pros have a hard time
weighing those details.
I can't trust you.
I'm a pro appraiser!
I swear by my eyes...
This is a real wooden trove!
It's never been opened,
and the treasure inside
hasn't been swapped out!
Okay,
let's assume that this is a
genuine wooden trove.
If the contents have been swapped out,
what would you do?
I'll be your slave for the rest of my life.
Give up.
Wow! Awesome!
Oh, so you're Zepile.
Thanks, Zepile-san.
You don't need to thank me.
Consider it give and take.
Twenty percent sounds fair.
Huh?
My cut when you sell the treasure.
What?
You're going to rob us?!
That's uncalled for.
It's my fee for providing advice.
I don't see a problem.
He helped us back there.
Now, look here...
We need to collect as much
Jenny as we possibly can.
I might be willing to buy him lunch.
Really?
Then I'll settle for that.
Huh?
So, Zepile-san...
Hmm?
I feel bad, so we'll pay you a fee.
There you go again!
Nah, it really is okay.
In return, just tell me something.
What tipped you off to bid on these items?
Is it okay to tell him the truth?
Well, it beats paying him.
I see, Nen aura...
If you're telling the truth,
that explains why you bought the statue,
not realizing something was hidden inside.
So, why do you need money so badly?
We can answer that question,
but not for free.
Afterwards, you have to answer our question.
Sure, that's fine.
There's an item we want
to buy at the auction.
That's why we need money.
Oh, which item are you interested in?
It's our turn now.
You estimated that this treasure
was worth 300 million, right?
Could we receive that much
at the trade market?
At the trade market?
They mainly deal in hard cash...
If you show up abruptly,
you won't get a fair price.
What?
Seriously?
Now it's my turn.
I'll repeat the question.
Which item do you want?
A game called Greed Island.
Oh, that ridiculously expensive game?
How much is that weird pot
that you bought worth?
Huh? This?
It's garbage.
Nothing at all.
Why do you want that expensive game?
I believe it costs 6 billion?
The asking price is 8.9 billion.
We're looking for his dad.
That game has a clue inside.
Oh...
Why did you choose that pot?
If you knew the wooden trove was real,
shouldn't you have bid on
the more valuable item?
But you went for the pot.
Why?
You see...
I made this pot.
Huh?
But it wasn't an original creation.
It was a replica.
In other words, a counterfeit.
When I was destitute,
this was how I made Jenny.
Once I became an appraiser
and began earning money,
I quit doing that.
When I see how poorly these are made,
I feel mortified!
So I browse the markets and buy them back.
How much would a real one cost?
It's my turn.
What does your dad do?
He's a pro Hunter.
How much would a real one cost?!
Forty to fifty thousand.
Is that so? A pro Hunter, huh?
There are a few in the antiques world,
and not one of them is ordinary.
Won't it be impossible for you
two to find him alone?
It'll be fine.
I'm a pro Hunter, too.
Huh? Seriously?
Okay, your turn to ask a question.
Okay, this is my final question.
Can I help you with anything?
Huh?
If you want to make money at an auction,
you'll need an appraiser.
You could even say that with an appraiser,
you can always turn a profit.
You can set the price you want to pay me.
How's that?
Then you have to answer our last question.
Why do you want to help us?
Because it made me happy...
It made me happy that this piece of junk
actually caught your eye.
It's not a piece of junk!
It definitely holds your Nen.
Everyone has some aura...
But it's incredibly difficult to harness!
You must concentrate and
train for a very long time.
I can tell how much effort you
put into making that pot!
You have a lot of talent!
I still think it's a weird pot, though.
My eyes didn't deceive me.
When you appraise objects long enough,
you also become a good judge of character.
I look at the sellers and the buyers too,
not just the merchandise.
It's a lot harder to appraise humans
than it is to appraise antiques.
When I saw you, I knew right away...
That I wanted to work with you.
That's my answer.
What's yours?
Looking forward to it.
We'll decide your fee after
we see how you do.
Okay! With that settled...
But first...
Huh?
Teach me those techniques
you talked about earlier.
You're interested?
Yep!
Hoodwinking, double-dipping, welding...
What else is there?
Seriously...
That isn't important at all!
But they sound fun!
Like magic tricks!
We're not here to have fun!
Now I understand why this kid interests me.
He doesn't care about right or wrong.
When I admitted to making forgeries
and when that trader gave me a hard time...
He didn't react with accusatory glares
or by plotting his own evil deeds.
His reaction was very simple.
Innocent curiosity!
He opens his mind to everything that
impresses him, right or wrong.
Which means that he's dangerous...
Someone who can never truly be appraised.
Welding is the hardest
technique to see through.
But recently, a new technique has surfaced.
It's known as exposing.
You plainly reveal the opened statue
along with a fake treasure.
Because people assume
that you wouldn't open the statue
if the treasure were fake,
you can fool them.
But now this technique is getting old.
When people started to get suspicious,
a new technique emerged.
Can you guess what it is?
I know.
The treasure inside is also fake!
Wrong!
I know!
Remove the treasure from a different place!
Bingo!
You can create a new opening
and remove the treasure,
then insert the fake
treasure and seal the hole.
This is known as side-stepping.
Side-stepping...
Many veteran appraisers have been fooled.
They assume the statue is real if the
adhesive hasn't changed color
from the application of fire.
That's how they fool the pros.
You live in an incredible world.
Hello?
What? A spider?
Yeah, this looks real.
There's a video attached.
We have two targets.
A man and a woman.
I'll leave now, so let's meet there.
Got it.
Let's go, Killua.
Yeah.
Hey! What about the auction?
We'll let you handle it!
Try to get us a good price!
Huh?
Okay! I've got it covered!
Gon and Killua have learned
about a whole new world.
And they are about to make
contact with the Phantom Troupe.
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
Coming up, we have Gon
and Killua's
Hunterpedia!
It's Gon
and Killua's
Hunterpedia!
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
Today, we introduce Shizuku.
A Phantom Troupe member.
A member of the Phantom Troupe.
She can conjure the vacuum cleaner Blinky.
Conjurer who uses a conjured
vacuum named Blinky.
But it can't suck up anything alive.
Its capacity is immeasurable!
Where do you go if you're sucked in?
No one knows.
Next Time: Pursuit x And x Analysis.
Right or left?
Right.
Do we go after the man or the woman?
The woman.
Should I use red or blue?
You can decide that for yourself!
﻿Yeah, this looks real.
There's a video attached.
We have two targets.
A man and a woman.
I'll leave now, so let's meet there.
Got it.
Let's go, Killua.
Yeah.
Pursuit x And x Analysis
After a tip about the Phantom Troupe,
Gon and his friends move out.
There, they encounter Machi and Nobunaga.
However, the two aren't just
waiting around to be caught.
Was Uvo really killed?
Probably.
Uvo was more than just a dumb brute.
I know that.
Even if he were fighting
a difficult opponent,
he had the wits and experience to prevail.
Hello?
I'm the one who submitted the request.
You're late! Where are you?
Stop looking around...
I can see you.
It's the couple behind your boyfriend?
I'll wire the money to you now,
so please confirm receipt.
For real?
Let's go!
Hurry!
But Uvo didn't return.
Has he ever been late without informing us?
But remember what he said?
He wasn't coming back until he
settled up with that chain user.
That's why I said probably.
I never said he was definitely dead.
Just a hunch?
Just a hunch.
Well, you're usually right.
Okay, we should decide our next move.
How do we catch those two?
It's impossible.
We aren't strong enough to handle them.
What was that?
We won't know until we try!
And why are you saying this now?!
Quiet... They'll notice us.
But it's still true.
I knew it as soon as I saw them.
My dad once had a hit on a Troupe member.
Huh?
What?
One of the few times I've
ever heard him complain.
Said the job wasn't worth the price.
That's considered the greatest
compliment a target can get.
That was when he told us
to stay away from the Troupe.
It's been a few years,
so I thought we might stand a chance...
They're really that strong?
Would it help you to picture
two Hisokas sitting there?
That is definitely not
something we can handle.
So, why do you think they're here?
Aren't they on a date?
Huh? Really?
No, they noticed that other
couple behind them.
They're paying close attention
to their surroundings.
At first, I thought it was just caution
because the Mafia is after them.
But in that case, they wouldn't
be sitting in a public place.
They aren't worried at all.
They're waiting for someone to find them.
Acting as bait, to draw out their prey.
We're being watched.
They aren't amateurs.
Yeah, I can't tell where they are,
but they're focused on us.
Is it the chain user?
No idea.
If it is, we'll follow the
boss' orders to go wild.
I believe the boss wishes to recruit him.
Machi...
The boss only told us to find
him and bring him back.
Have you forgotten the unspoken rule?
Alive or dead.
By any means necessary.
Right?
You're free to interpret the
boss' orders as you like,
but you can't force me to agree.
I haven't said anything yet.
You're the one forcing the issue.
The atmosphere changed.
I've got a really bad feeling...
Did they notice us?
It's okay.
They haven't noticed us yet.
Are you sure?
Besides, I can't use Zetsu like
you guys to mask my presence.
If we used Zetsu, that would
attract their attention.
They aren't trying to sense Nen.
They're trying to see if there's anyone
in this area who looks or acts suspicious.
So you'd better wipe those
looks off your faces.
Act normal.
Sorry, that was a bad idea.
Let's make it clear, then.
Are we going to take him dead, or alive?
Fine.
Heads.
Tails.
Her?
Yes, she is Nostrade's daughter.
Her name is Neon.
According to the online Hunter information,
the chain user is one of her bodyguards.
As for her other bodyguards,
we have pictures and names for these five.
And this girl is responsible
for Nostrade's success?
Most likely.
This information comes
from the Hunter website,
so it should be accurate.
I see...
Now I understand what happened.
It was wise to switch rooms.
The Phantom Troupe is definitely
using the pro Hunter website.
If you'd moved any later,
Neon might have been in danger.
I'm grateful.
Looking ahead, the first step
is to get my daughter home.
Is that okay, Neon?
Well, I don't have a choice.
The auction was canceled,
so I don't have any reason to stay.
I really wanted to go...
They'll hold another auction next year.
Cheer up.
And I promise I'll recover
the items you wanted from those bandits.
Really?
Yes, I promise.
Have I ever broken a promise?
Have you ever kept a promise?
You make a good point...
I believe your names are
Melody and Basho?
Yes...
You'll take Neon back to
the house immediately.
To be on the safe side,
use simple disguises.
Okay, Neon.
Return to your room and pack.
Okay.
All right, let's get down to our real business.
The auction will resume tonight.
The time and location haven't changed.
The community must demonstrate
that they will not allow anyone
to intimidate them.
The Ten Dons have vowed to
recover the stolen merchandise.
The stolen merchandise?
As I told you earlier,
the man we captured claimed
that a Shadow Beast had taken
everything before they arrived.
Yes, that's correct.
The Shadow Beasts appear to be wiped out.
Nine bodies have been recovered so far.
The final member, Owl, was the one
carrying the merchandise.
He was probably captured by the Troupe.
The Ten Dons understand how
frightening Nen can be.
If the Troupe has someone who can
use Nen to compel confession,
they wouldn't even need torture.
It's believed that the merchandise Owl took
has fallen into the Troupe's hands.
So, as I was saying,
with the Shadow Beasts
destroyed, the Ten Dons
are hiring professionals to handle the Troupe.
Professionals?
To the Mafia,
murder is a tool, not our trade.
Considering our opponents,
it would be better to leave it to the experts.
We'll have them
crush the Troupe for us,
while avoiding further losses.
However, it's also a chance to make a
name for ourselves in the community.
We cannot allow those hit men all the glory.
So, Kurapika...
I want you to join those hit men.
Take care of the chain user for me.
Got it.
They're on the move.
What should we do?
As I told you, we can't
beat them in a fight.
We'll find a way...
We have to.
Yeah.
We can't leave empty-handed.
Okay.
Then listen carefully.
Gon and I will tail them.
We absolutely cannot let them spot us.
We'll use Zetsu.
Wow...
I can see him standing here,
but I can't sense him.
Gon, I need you to make me two promises.
If they see us, we give up
immediately and escape.
If I judge that further pursuit is impossible
for any other reason, we give up.
Got it?
Uh-huh.
The signal to stop will be one phone call.
Make sure your phone's on vibrate.
If they split up, we follow the woman.
Leorio,
contact Zepile, and keep an
eye on the auction for us.
Got it.
I'm guessing you've never
tailed anyone before?
Um...
Well...
During the Hunter Exam, I trailed Hisoka.
Really? Without his noticing?
Yeah, I was on his tail for a whole day.
Wow, not bad.
Ow... Why did you hit me?
Uh, it seemed appropriate.
Well, then you should have no problem.
Be sure to stay out of
their field of vision.
Okay, let's go.
Yeah!
The targets have passed the plaza
and entered a side street.
Okay, confirmed.
Do they know we're here?
It's okay.
We're using Zetsu, so they shouldn't notice
us unless something's really wrong.
But they're on constant guard
against pursuers, so stay vigilant.
Yeah.
You, too.
Tsk, he's telling me to be careful?
I'm the one who has to be alert to
any change in their movements.
It's okay.
They haven't noticed us.
When they realize we're here,
they'll react in some way.
They can try to conceal it,
but their faces or behavior will betray it.
I've been put through life-or-death
shadowing exercises since I was three.
I won't fail and lose sight of them!
Are we being followed?
Most likely, I'd guess.
I'm impressed.
I can't sense a thing.
They must be quite skilled.
Crap, they're moving toward a deserted area.
They must realize by now that
they're being followed.
Then is this a trap?
No, they don't know our exact locations.
Or maybe they don't know they're being
followed and are heading back to base.
That would make this a huge success.
Is this a trap?
Or their hideout?
Which is it?
If it's a trap, we should run immediately.
If it's their hideout, we should continue.
They're acting calm...
We continue!
Our stalker isn't taking the bait.
It probably isn't the chain user.
Why not?
I can sense multiple people tailing us.
But the chain user works alone.
How can you be sure?
He's a member of the
Nostrade Family, right?
Yet he managed to defeat Uvo on his own.
I'm sure because the Mafia
hasn't taken any action.
If the Mafia were responsible,
they would use Uvo as a chip
against us, dead or alive.
Had they killed him, the news would
probably be on the Net by now.
Since there's nothing,
the chain user probably defeated Uvo alone,
without reporting it to the Mafia.
Why would someone who works
for the Mafia operate solo?
It was probably a personal grudge.
You're using "probably" a lot.
Shut up.
I doubt that someone seeking
revenge without Mafia backup
would team up with anyone else.
Thus, the chain user is operating alone
and unrelated to the group now pursuing us.
Your theory has a lot of holes.
Then what do you think?
Indeed...
I suspect that there's a link between
this tail and the chain user.
You just know?
I just know.
Man...
People who act on instinct
shouldn't criticize theories.
Well, Killua?
They're waiting for someone
or trying to lure us out.
One or the other.
Do they know we're following them?
Right now, it's fifty-fifty.
But they don't know our location.
They want to draw us out because
they don't know where we are.
They're inviting us to show ourselves.
What do we do?
They may be waiting for someone else.
Hold your position and wait.
Gon, I'm hanging up.
Pay close attention.
If they give any kind of reaction,
we'll run for it!
Escape as soon as I ring the phone.
Got it?
Yeah, got it.
Phinks here.
Oh, what's up?
I wanted to see how you were doing.
We're being followed,
but they haven't made a move.
And we can't locate them,
so this will take a while.
Oh, then would you like some helpful info?
Hmm? What do you mean?
The stones were a distraction?
This'll get him!
He stopped me with ease...
With one hand!
Yo.
Phinks, why are you here?
Weren't you heading out with the boss?
This is the fourth floor.
To fool the enemy,
you first fool your allies.
The boss got me good again.
I wondered why there were so
many Zetsu masters around.
Stalking the stalkers?
Mustache-guy and the woman didn't know?
They fooled us!
Okay, kid.
I have a few questions for you.
Boy, do you know the chain user?
Huh?
A Nen user who uses chains to fight.
We're looking for him.
He asked you to follow us, right?
I don't know who that is.
We were following you
for our own reasons.
I just need one moment...
With an opening, I can escape!
Well?
Well, indeed...
If he's lying, he's really good.
I can check.
Question 1...
Why were you following us?
Answer concisely.
Lying will only make the situation worse.
The Mafia has put a huge
bounty on your heads.
Websites are offering a lot of money
just for information on your location.
Question 2...
Who taught you to shadow people?
Well, mainly,
I was using Zetsu, a Nen ability,
to conceal my presence.
I'm trying to become a pro Hunter.
Who taught you how to do that?
A Shingen-ryu master.
Question 3...
Do you know a Nen user
who fights with chains?
Chains?
He would be a Conjurer or Manipulator.
Does your master have chains
hanging from his right arm?
Or perhaps it's you?
I don't know.
My master is an Enhancer,
and he only taught me the
four major principles.
I see... Well, nothing we
can do, if you don't know.
Time for the last question, then.
You have two choices.
Consider carefully before you answer.
Do you want to die now or later?
Make your choice.
You have three seconds to answer.
It's useless.
Don't try anything foolish.
Yes...
Understood, we'll head over.
Boy, your friend surrendered.
I'll ask you once more.
Do you know the chain user?
My answer is the same.
I don't.
I see.
How about you?
Any guesses?
Welcome to our base.
They stand inside the
Phantom Troupe's hideout...
...nerves mounting to their limits.
Brush Your Teeth.

Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
Coming up, we have Gon
and Killua's
Hunterpedia!
It's Gon
and Killua's
Hunterpedia!
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
Today, we introduce Machi.
A Phantom Troupe member.
A Phantom Troupe member.
She's a Transmuter.
Transmutes aura into Nen
threads that she controls.
She can turn her aura into Nen threads.
Her special technique is Nen Stitches.
She can put your body back together!
Like this!
Next time: Ally x And x Sword.
Snatch!
Bam!
Look! I caught it!
That's one of Milluki's miniature bombs!
Ka-boom!
﻿Play dumb.
That's right...
He likes Gon, so he'll bail us out.
Idiot!
Oh... Oops.
What is it?
You know someone here?
Ah! No...
It's that girl!
Oh? You know them, Shizuku?
Nope, never seen them before.
Huh?
Oh, I remember...
It's the arm wrestling kid.
Who was that?
Two days ago, you lost to
that kid at arm wrestling.
Lost? I lost?
That's a lie.
I would never lose to a kid.
Well, you were using your right hand...
Why? I'm left-handed.
Don't bother.
Once Shizuku's forgotten something,
she'll never remember.
Never mind... I was mistaken.
Thought so.
Oh?
You actually beat Shizuku?
Yeah.
Never would've imagined she
was a Troupe member.
Okay, I'll challenge you.
Ally x And x Sword
One more time.
Ready...
Go.
One more time.
Ready...
Go.
Hey...
When it comes to arm wrestling,
what's my rank among the spiders?
Seventh or eighth?
You're not weak, but you're
not strong, either.
And the strongest was this guy called Uvogin.
But apparently, he was
killed by the chain user.
We already said we don't know who that is!
Kid!
If you speak without permission again,
I'll kill you.
One more time.
Ready...
Go.
He was an Enhancer.
Simple-minded and straightforward,
he loved a good, all-out fight.
But he was fussy about time.
He'd get into fights
with Franklin and me when we were late.
He'd beat the crap out of me
in an unarmed brawl...
I've known him since before
the Troupe was founded.
I know him better than anyone.
He would never...
Uvo would never lose in a fight!
He must've been caught in some dirty trap!
I will make his killer pay.
I'll find him, no matter
how many I have to kill.
The chain user bears a
strong grudge against us.
The Mafia's Nostrade Family
hired him recently.
A grudge against the Troupe?
Recently hired...
You might not know him directly,
but you may have heard stories of him!
Think hard...
If you have any guesses, spill them!
I don't know anything.
But even if I did, I would never tell you!
I thought you were a bunch
of heartless monsters,
but you'll mourn the death
of one of your own?
Why couldn't you spare...
Spare a fraction of that grief...
for the people you've killed?!
You're getting too cocky.
Gon!
Another step, and I'll cut you up.
Answer the question.
Do you know who the chain user is?
I already said I have nothing to tell you!
Feitan...
Stop.
Stop what?
Stop what you're about to do.
You know what I'm about to do?
You're going to break his arm, right?
I'd start with a finger...
Peel off a nail.
Doesn't matter where you'd start.
Just stop!
Why are you giving me orders?
I have no reason to listen to you.
Hey, quit it, Nobunaga.
Have you forgotten the rules?
Troupe members aren't allowed
to start serious fights.
I know!
If there's a dispute, we flip a coin.
Tails.
Heads!
It's heads.
Let him go.
So, what do we do with them?
They haven't told us anything
about the chain user yet.
If they don't know anything,
we can let them go.
Well, Pakunoda?
I checked on the trip here.
They really don't know anything.
You're sure?
Yes.
They have no memories of the chain user.
Seems your instinct was off this time.
That's odd...
Well, if Pakunoda says so, it must be true.
Hey, Gon!
Did they do anything to you
on the way over here?
No, they just asked me a few questions.
Thought so...
Then they learned what they wanted
without our realizing.
What was it? And how?
Sounds like they really trust
Pakunoda's judgment.
She must possess a skill more
convincing than mere instinct.
They have no memories of the chain user.
Memories?
How about you?
Any guesses?
The power to scan someone's memory!
By touching them?
That would explain everything.
And we're in trouble.
When she scanned us before, I had
no idea who the chain user was.
But now, I have an image in my head.
If she checks again...
If they have nothing to do
with the chain user,
we can let them go?
Yeah, there's no point
in keeping them here.
No, we can't be sure they're
completely unrelated.
It's possible they're being used.
If the chain user typically conceals his chains,
they wouldn't realize he was the chain user.
We shouldn't release them until they
tell us who they're working for.
Assuming they're working for someone else,
it wouldn't be the chain user.
Because he operates alone.
Then you agree with Nobunaga.
Rather than use a couple of kids,
we can find the information we need
through the Nostrade Family.
Since we know the chain user's a member.
That's true.
Our target is the chain user.
We should ignore everyone else.
There you go.
You kids are lucky.
No, not yet.
I won't let him leave.
Kid...
Join the spiders.
Team up with me.
No way.
I'd rather die than join you guys!
He really hates us...
You're an Enhancer, right?
What if I am?!
I knew it!
Hey!
We're keeping them here
until the boss gets back.
I'm going to recommend we recruit them.
Are you serious?
The boss will never agree to that.
Well, it's your call.
But you have to watch them.
You can't blame us if they escape.
He reminds you of Uvo?
Yeah, he wears his emotions on his sleeve.
And when he's angry,
he forgets about consequences.
Most of all,
he's strongest when fighting
for someone else.
He did like to fight alone.
But he was strongest
when he'd team up with
Nobunaga to fight a horde.
Uvo never admitted it,
but he preferred having
someone to protect.
Then, he was stronger with
someone holding him back.
Well, I guess you could say that.
Shizuku is always so uncharitable...
On the other hand, Nobunaga's
skills are superior for duels.
You could even say that they're
really only effective one-on-one.
Whenever they had assignments to fight
together, they always complained.
But in truth, they seemed to enjoy it.
Okay,
that's enough reminiscing.
Let's get down to business.
Here's a list of Nostrade Family members
taken from the Hunter website.
These five are particularly important.
They serve as bodyguards for
the daughter of the boss.
And they're the ones who captured Uvo.
But Uvo said that the chain
user wasn't on this list.
Since we don't know the
chain user's appearance,
we'll have to find someone who does.
Oh, that's the guy I killed.
Cross out the top left guy.
Move around in pairs,
and search for the people on that list.
Then we'll meet back here
at 10 PM. That's all.
Wait.
Nobunaga's staying here, right?
What should I do?
You can team up with whoever's left.
Ow...
I was a fool.
If I'd made a move,
Hisoka wouldn't have hesitated to kill me.
That murderous aura...
I was frozen in place.
If Gon had suffered a lethal blow,
would I have been able to move?
That's impossible.
Your only concern when you meet someone
is whether you should kill them.
You're wrong...
"Never fight an enemy you can't beat."
I drilled that into you...
You're wrong!
Scary...
You look like you want to kill me.
Let me warn you first.
Step into range, and I'll cut you down.
Killua!
I stand no chance against him.
I have to think of a way to escape...
No windows.
One exit.
How can we get him to move away?
Is Leorio okay?
I hope he was able to find Zepile-san.
Killua, are you okay?
Yeah.
Hey,
Zepile-san taught us welding, exposing...
What else was there?
I forgot.
Side-stomping, maybe?
I don't think that was it...
Gon...
I'll act as a decoy.
Use that chance to escape.
What are you talking about?
Seriously.
Forget it.
You're smart enough to know
how much stronger I am.
There won't be any chances.
I already know that!
This room only has one exit
and nowhere to hide.
He can see everything we're doing.
We're facing someone who can watch
us without creating an opening.
He's probably an iaido master.
With his shodachi, his range
is at least two times mine.
If I take one step too close,
he'll strike a fatal blow.
But that's the point!
You can't do it.
Shut up!
I won't know until I try!
Killua, what are you thinking?
I'll stop his shodachi, even if it kills me.
Use that chance to run away!
Huh?
What was that for?!
Don't be so selfish!
Don't talk about dying like it's nothing!
What?!
You did the same thing earlier!
I'm allowed to do it!
But you aren't!
Huh?
You can't use logic against an Enhancer...
We can't escape unless we're
prepared to die, stupid!
You have no idea what I was thinking...
Who's the selfish one?!
Yes, I've no idea...
Because I'm stupid!
You kids are hilarious!
Hey, I'm not gonna hurt you or anything.
Just behave yourselves.
I know you're serious.
Don't throw your lives away.
Wait until the boss gets back.
If he won't give his approval, you can leave.
But if you try to escape, I'll kill you.
Don't make me draw my sword.
If I pull it out, you'll die...
I remember now!
It was side-stepping!
Welding, exposing...
And the last one was side-stepping!
Do you remember now?
Yeah, I sure do!
See?
How could we forget something so simple?
Huh?
Now that we've figured that out...
Let's go!
Are you serious?
You're going to die.
I'm not skilled or merciful enough
to control my strength.
Fools!
If the exit is blocked...
Make your own!
The wall...
Tsk, which one do I chase?
We're on the fifth floor.
The kid with slanted eyes
is already close to the stairs.
So the black-haired kid!
Now he has nowhere to run.
Am I an idiot?
They can break through walls to escape!
The slanted-eyed kid is below.
I'll have to follow the black-haired one.
Where is he?
The walls are intact...
So is the door.
Killua, are you there?
Yeah, I'm here!
That's it!
That last hole was a decoy!
He broke it before hiding in the nearby room,
waiting for me to pass,
before stepping into the hallway.
We can beat him together!
His presence disappeared... Zetsu?
Does the idiot want to fight me?
An advanced application of Ten and Ren.
En!
En
Normally, you shroud your body in aura
that extends a few
millimeters from your body.
But with En, you extend that
aura as far as necessary.
You can sense anyone who
steps inside your En.
Inside it, you can even count
the leaves as they fall.
You can conceal your presence and approach,
never making a sound.
But step within my En,
and I'll swing my sword.
Come to me.
Stupid.
Man, I wanted to beat him up.
That was impossible.
He'd have fought you off and killed you.
One hundred percent guaranteed?
We don't have a chance
only knowing the basics of Nen.
What is it?
You finally sound like yourself again.
It's my job to say crazy stuff.
Your job is to stay cool and stop me.
So I'm counting on you!
You're so selfish.
Well? What do we do next?
That depends on what you want to do.
I want to defeat those guys.
Well, that matches our original objective.
But we'll have to improve our Nen to do that.
Nen has the potential to give us the power
we'd need to stand a chance.
And the fastest way to learn more
would be to ask Kurapika.
Huh? Why?
Because Kurapika is the chain user
who defeated one of them.
Huh?
You didn't realize it?
Is that really true?
I'm pretty confident.
If it's true, we have a chance.
Because we learned Nen around
the same time Kurapika did.
We need to learn the techniques
appropriate to our abilities.
And most importantly,
we need the strength to fight the Troupe.
And Kurapika is the key to
finding those answers?
Yeah.
At the same time, a new storm brews
at the heart of Yorknew City.
Brush Your Teeth.

Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
Today, we introduce Franklin,
A Phantom Troupe member.
a member of the Phantom Troupe.
He's an Emitter.
An Emitter.
His attack Double Machine Gun fires Nen bullets.
Transforms hands into
machine guns that fire
Nen bullets.
Retool your fingers for an extra punch!
Next time: A x Brutal x Battlefield.
Out.
Out?
Outfield!
Infield!
﻿Ah, this is the foundation I wanted!
I also want this lipstick and manicure spray.
Oh, what a cute wig...
Boss, we should get going soon.
Just a little longer.
I should buy this camisole too.
Her shopping's gonna be the death of me.
I concur.
A x Brutal x Battlefield
Was there anything else we needed?
Did you want anything, Eliza?
No, nothing at all.
I have to go to the restroom.
It's okay...
Watch my stuff for me.
Will Kurapika be okay?
I used my flute to help him recover a little.
How do you feel about the
whole assassins business?
The Ten Dons are hiring professionals
to handle the Troupe.
Professionals?
So, Kurapika...
I want you to join those hit men.
Judging by his heartbeat,
he wasn't entirely pleased
about joining the hit men.
Of course not.
However, Kurapika is extremely determined.
To achieve his goal, he's certainly
willing to sacrifice everything.
That's a hard road...
I couldn't do it.
What's the point of a life in which
you're basically killing yourself?
She's taking a long time.
Once we finish this job,
I'm using the money to see
the world on my bike.
That sounds really nice.
Not enjoying yourself is a crime.
There are many ways to spend a life.
Everyone has different ideas
about what's important.
Huh?
What's wrong?
She's gone!
Huh?
What?!
Daddy's such a liar!
He wasn't going to take me to the auction!
Fine, I'll just go by myself!
Come in.
Forever Active
One, two, three, four, five, six...
Looks like everyone's here.
No, not yet.
I thought the team only had eight members.
Nostrade is sending an additional person.
Tsk, the guy who uses that
voodoo fortunetelling?
Then, has everyone arrived?
The job is to annihilate the Phantom Troupe.
When the auction kicks off again,
they may show up.
If they do, dispose of them.
You're free to use any means you want.
This team will be after the same target.
We should decide how we address
each other when communicating.
Just use colors.
Call me Blue.
I'll be Red.
It's like playing a game.
Eh? What about you guys?
Silva.
I'm Zeno.
Zeno? What color is that?
We will both use our real names.
What?
You're welcome to call me by name,
but I won't take orders.
We'll do this our own way.
Silva and Zeno...
Of the Zoldyck family?
Let me know if you want someone killed.
I'm willing to give you a thirty percent
discount for being in the same line of work.
They're from Killua's family.
Does it really matter
what we call one another?
Agreed.
There's no requirement we work together.
But we're talking about the Troupe.
Attacking alone will be dangerous.
And you?
Shaky teamwork will only cause confusion.
I will move alone.
So it's 5 to 4.
We have our answer.
The auction begins at nine.
We will transport you to the auction hall.
Please wait here until it's time.
Yo, Nostrade...
How are you feeling?
Not too bad.
Not too bad?
You've gotten pretty full of yourself.
Not too long ago, you were just
leading a little country gang,
and now you're acting like my equal.
I hear you've been rubbing your hands
together so much, your skin rubbed off.
You okay?
It's sad when a man shows jealousy.
Bastard!
What's this about?
Go ahead and stick that knife in me!
Kurapika, that's enough!
Let's be clear...
No one's impressed by you!
Many people envy my success,
while they ignore their own failings.
However, I intend to continue to rise.
By using Neon's fortunetelling.
I expect great things from you.
You will be appropriately rewarded
when the time comes.
Yes.
The police are cooperating?
Sixty percent of the votes
in the Yorknew City mayoral
election were bought.
And the police chief is the mayor's protégé.
Redirecting traffic is quite easy for us.
Hello?
Kurapika, it's terrible.
The boss ran away!
She changed clothes in the restroom,
so she must have planned ahead.
Then I can guess where she's going.
Return to the hotel and stand by.
What's wrong?
Your daughter's run away.
What?!
We probably have the same destination.
The auction?
Damn, she's turned off her phone.
But Neon doesn't have a pass...
She'll be turned away at the gate.
This is Light Nostrade!
I need you to convey an order
to all the guards at the gate!
If a girl about seventeen or
eighteen arrives with no pass,
they should take her into custody!
Her description...
Okay, please go ahead.
Whew,
I was stuck without a way
to get past that gate.
Thank you so much.
You're very welcome.
Really?! When was that?
About five minutes ago...
Her hair and attire were slightly
different, but it was probably her.
She didn't have a pass?
She didn't appear to realize that
the auction required a pass.
She mentioned something about
her daddy, but then she left.
Yes, she got in a taxi alone.
Yes, goodbye.
Nice work.
Neon, where have you gone?
I'll search for her.
Do you have a map of the city?
I've heard that you're a good fortuneteller.
Huh?
Someone once mentioned it to me.
I can't remember who...
I'm good.
Important people request
my services all the time.
What's your accuracy?
They say I'm always right.
They say?
Aren't you the one telling the fortunes?
My hand moves on its own.
Oh, how impressive.
Would you tell me mine?
Sure.
Write your full name, date of birth,
and blood type on a sheet of paper.
Will this work?
Let me see.
Chrollo Lucilfer...
That's a strange name.
My friends call me "boss."
What?
That's even stranger!
Then, I'll tell your fortune.
Your daughter is already in the
Cemetery Building on the auction site.
What? But how?!
Regardless, we should hurry.
Okay, all done.
May I have a look?
Sure.
My fortunes are a little strange.
They usually have four or five verses.
Each one corresponds to
a week of the month,
so the first may have already happened.
Oh...
The calendar loses a precious component.
The remaining months gather to mourn.
The mourners play a melody,
while the eleventh moon quietly rises.
Amazing.
It's correct.
About this first verse...
Huh?
Oh, stop...
I never look at the fortunes I write.
Why not?
I have a feeling they're more accurate
if I stay away from them.
Then may I ask you a question?
Uh-huh.
This verse refers to a requiem for the dead.
Do you believe in the afterlife?
Hmm...
Not really.
My fortunes are for people who are alive.
Like you, Chrollo-san.
I'm guessing that the requiem
is meant to help you, not the dead.
You're probably right.
Let's go.
They'll let us start browsing
at the auction soon.
Actually, I heard that from someone else.
Eh?
When I was little, I saw a
fortuneteller on TV say that.
That fortunes were meant to
make the living happy.
Really?
So the fortuneteller tried to
avoid giving negative fortunes.
Negative fortunes?
The idea was
to encourage people to wish for and
work toward better things.
At the time, I was really moved...
From then on, I wanted to be a fortuneteller.
The calendar loses a precious component.
The remaining months gather to mourn.
The mourners play a melody,
while the eleventh moon quietly rises.
The chrysanthemum withers and falls,
to lie on the ground beside bloody Scarlet Eyes.
But you will remain supreme.
Even after losing half your limbs.
Enjoy the interlude.
Search out new allies.
East is the direction to go.
You will find one who awaits you.
A few years later, that fortuneteller
was arrested for being a con artist.
Are you talking about the Galactic Grandma?
Yep!
I remember that she didn't
believe in the afterlife.
Right, so that's why I don't, either.
Personally, I believe in ghosts.
Huh?
And that's why I'll do as he
would have wanted.
What do you mean?
Go wild.
Are you okay?
Call a doctor!
We're on the first floor,
by the north elevator.
Someone's ill. Call an ambulance.
We can't.
They won't let an ambulance
inside without a pass.
What did you say?
What if the unthinkable happens?!
This is the daughter of the
Nostrade Family boss!
Will you take responsibility for her life?!
Tsk, got it.
She has fans among the Ten Dons.
Fine, we'll make it happen.
Hey, call for an ambulance!
Got it.
Are you able to rewind this monitor?
Huh? Yeah.
That chop was incredibly fast...
Only I could have caught it.
It's been a while since I was this excited.
There is my prey.
Nostrade-sama, your daughter is
resting in room 501, on the fifth floor.
She shouldn't have been able to secure a pass...
How did she get in?
Your daughter's picture is on the Hunter website.
What?
Most likely, someone found
this picture on the site,
approached her, and then brought her here.
I'll find that person and kill him!
Please remain calm.
I don't believe capturing your
daughter was their objective.
She may have been a hostage in case they
had trouble infiltrating the building.
It's dangerous here.
I called Melody and Basho.
They should arrive soon.
Can I trust them?
You should go with them.
But the auction...
There won't be one.
This place will become a battlefield.
The auction will be postponed again.
A trail of blood.
He wants to be found...
By leaving a scent that only another killer
would catch.
You are just like me.
We are the same.
Addicted to murder.
Relax.
I won't use any cheap tricks.
Let's play one-on-one.
Yeah.
I have a message from the boss.
He wants to go wild in the Cemetery
Building, so we should come.
We aren't too far away.
What about everyone else?
The rest had the same idea.
They've been cleaning up the trash,
while approaching the building.
Okay, then let's go.
Also, the boss actually added a rule this time.
A rule? What?
Go absolutely crazy.
The calendar loses a precious component.
The remaining months gather to mourn.
The mourners play a melody,
while the eleventh moon quietly rises.
The chrysanthemum withers and falls,
to lie on the ground beside bloody Scarlet Eyes.
But you will remain supreme.
Even after losing half your limbs.
Enjoy the interlude.
Search out new allies.
East is the direction to go.
You will find one who awaits you.
Why?
Why?
Why am I still alive?
This is known as an Indoor Fish.
Made from Nen, it can only
exist in enclosed spaces.
It's a carnivore that enjoys human flesh.
Its victims don't bleed or feel pain.
And they won't die until the
Indoor Fish disappears.
Won't die...
The calendar loses a precious component.
The remaining months gather to mourn.
The mourners play a melody,
while the eleventh moon quietly rises.
Uvo-san,
can you hear us?
We are playing a requiem for you.
It was the start of a stormy night,
fierce and drenched with blood,
yet somehow overwhelmingly sad.

Today, we introduce Phinks.
A Phantom Troupe member.
A member of the Phantom Troupe.
He's an Enhancer.
An Enhancer.
He's strong enough to punch through a body.
The greater the windup,
the stronger his punch.
Sometimes, he dresses like an Egyptian mummy.
It's his name.
Next time: Assault x And x Impact.
Oh, Gon...
Wherefore art thou Gon?!
Killua, that's because
I'm Gon!
That's it?
﻿The calendar loses a precious component.
The remaining months gather to mourn.
The mourners play a melody,
while the eleventh moon quietly rises.
Assault x And x Impact
We will be making an emergency stop.
Please watch your step.
Did something happen?
We are currently evaluating the situation.
Beats me.
It's me.
Are they here?
Yeah, it's gotta be them!
They're the only ones strong enough to fight
a whole crowd alone!
Hey... Hey!
Damn!
Figure out how many enemies we're up against!
Listen up! Do whatever
it takes to stop them!
Do not let them near this building!
They're late...
Our escort isn't here yet?
Their names are Melody and Basho.
All traffic in Yorknew City has been stopped.
They're probably stuck.
It's dangerous for Neon to be here!
Isn't there any way to evacuate her?
The ambulance we requested is on its way.
Please wait a little longer.
Ambulance?
Yes, that's right.
Something's wrong here.
The man who entered
the building with Neon
and then called for a doctor...
Boss.
Kurapika, don't take one step away
from my daughter until the ambulance arrives.
Got it?
But my assignment is to kill
the Phantom Troupe.
At the time, I thought that
Neon would already be home.
But instead, she's unconscious here,
exposed to the Troupe.
I absolutely must ensure Neon's safety.
Stay here for the time being.
I'm begging you.
Understood.
What a pity...
They aren't putting up much of a fight.
Well, I guess it was stupid to expect more—
Damn...
They're crazier than I've heard,
launching a frontal attack with ten people.
Man...
When did this place turn into a battlefield?
Where is the patient?
There's nothing to prove that you
aren't a Phantom Troupe member.
One funny move, and I'll blow your head off.
Follow me.
Please allow me to check you all.
What's that?
Bastard...
Currently, all trains have been stopped.
For your safety, please wait patiently.
I'm not getting any reception down here.
And we don't know when the
trains will start moving again.
That settles it... We'll have to run.
You were hired to be an assassin,
so stop hiding in this room, and go fight.
Or did you get scared once
the Troupe showed up?
Oh, actually...
I requested that Kurapika stay here.
I understand that he's been
hired by the Ten Dons,
but I was worried about my daughter.
I don't intend to sell you out.
But you're being paid well,
so I expect you to do your job.
I agree
that I must do something.
I could at least patrol this building.
Yes, I suppose.
But you must come immediately if I call.
My daughter's safety comes first.
Understood.
How long do we have to wait?
Hey, what's going on outside?
I can hear explosions nearby!
When will the auction start?
Explain what's going on.
P-Please wait a little longer.
Tell us whether the auction's still on or not!
Everyone here is a gang leader or a big shot.
They're endangering themselves to prove
that they aren't afraid of the Troupe.
Return my phone!
I've no idea what's happening outside.
I need my weapons, too!
As you already know, weapons are banned.
What if they get inside?
Are we supposed to fight with our bare hands?!
It's becoming chaotic here...
The auctioneers and handlers will lose control
of the situation very soon.
Hello?
Oh, Kurapika?
Huh?
Whew, we finally got a hold of you.
Is this Gon?!
Yep, can you talk right now?
Uh, sorry, I'm in the middle of something.
I'll call you back.
Wait!
Can you give me one minute?
I have something to tell you.
Killua and I ran into the Troupe.
Actually, they caught us.
What were you guys thinking?!
Do you realize how dangerous they are?
Let me talk.
I thought I knew, but after we met
them, it became painfully clear.
They're strong.
Right now, we have no chance against them.
That's why we need your assistance.
We want to help.
That's ridiculous.
I won't help you get yourselves killed.
Don't you want to know where their base is?
I have my own sources of information.
Do you know all of their powers?
Enough! Just stay away from the Troupe!
You're the chain user who killed
one of their members, right?
They're looking everywhere for you.
If you won't treat us as friends or equals,
we'll do whatever we must to help!
Kurapika...
One of their members cried in front of us.
He said that he couldn't forgive
whoever killed his friend.
I got really mad after seeing that.
I couldn't let that go.
We want to stop them!
Please, Kurapika...
I'll call you back.
If you won't treat us as friends or equals...
We want to stop them!
Here they come!
Don't let them escape!
I can feel the heat!
Someone's coming!
Does he have a gun?
Who's stationed here?
I-It's no use.
They're too strong.
We don't stand a chance...
How strong are they?!
This strong!
Damn it!
Aw, he broke.
I need to find my next machine.
Are you okay?
I found the corpse of one of the assassins!
Someone's already inside the building!
Damn it.
It's hopeless!
Hey, don't run away!
Fight!
Man, what's going on?
It's me.
Where's our backup?
What are you doing?
They should be there any moment.
We'll be arriving shortly...
You can't mean...
The two thousand men that were
supposed to assemble here
have all been wiped out?
Now what?
There are Troupe members inside the building.
It's me, Bean!
Get the Ten Dons on the line.
It's urgent!
The intruder must be a member of the Troupe.
Their objective is to steal the rest of the
merchandise and avenge their comrade.
He said that he couldn't forgive
whoever killed his friend.
That's what I wanted!
Hey! Enough already!
Give us the weapons we handed over!
But the rules state that...
To hell with the rules!
Do you understand our situation?!
I know you've got professional assassins
wandering around this place!
If you're gonna depend on those freaks,
you might as well let us fight!
My name is Zeno Zoldyck.
The famous Zoldyck family of assassins!
The Ten Dons called in these monsters?
At the moment, one bandit has
infiltrated this building.
He has killed a number of the assassins
that your people hired.
Even if you were fully armed,
it would take me seven seconds
to kill the lot of you.
The enemy is capable of a similar feat.
If you understand, shut up and wait.
It's a different story if you want to die...
Well?
A single strike from behind.
Beautiful.
His presence was only exposed
for a brief instant,
and barely any trace remains.
I suppose I'll have to use En.
It's an exhausting technique.
Let's start from the roof and head down...
This building's radius is one hundred meters.
Will you be okay, old man?
Fool, if I wanted, I could
handle three times that.
This job is hardly worth the pay...
You're late, Kurapika!
Hurry back right now.
Stay at Neon's side!
Right, I'm on my way.
Damn!
We meet again.
You remember me?
How could I forget?
You killed one of my people.
It was difficult.
Careful, old man.
He can steal your techniques.
This could be hard, fighting one on two.
It takes a quality knife to scratch me.
Looks to be a mid-era Ben's knife.
That shape...
It's poisoned?
You okay?
I'm just fine.
Just fine?
A tenth of a milligram will
completely paralyze a whale.
So you can steal other people's Nen?
You must be a Specialist.
I would consider you a threat if you
could freely use the powers you steal.
However, you must take risks
to take those abilities.
A technique that strong must
have its drawbacks...
I would guess
you must clear four or five conditions
before you can steal an ability.
Correct.
The old man's a difficult opponent.
It will be difficult to clear those
conditions while you fight us.
Meaning that you won't be able
to steal our abilities while we fight.
Proven by your need to use a
poisoned knife as a deterrent.
Correct again.
I have no choice.
Silva, I'll need your support.
Once I lock him in place,
kill him, even if you have
to kill me with him.
Understood.
He focused his aura into his hand.
He has incredible potential.
I won't be able to block that attack.
Skill Hunter:
Bandit's Secret
A mantle...
A Conjurer ability?
This could be difficult...
Even if it's a stolen ability,
I can't attack recklessly
without knowing what it's capable of.
That would be an ordinary fighter's reaction...
Dragon Head: Long-Tou Xi-Hua
Dragon Lance
I see now...
His power is to seal other people's abilities
in that Conjured book
letting him use them freely.
In return, when he uses another ability,
he must hold that book
in his hands at all times.
The mantle is also a Conjured item.
He has shown no signs of taking the offensive,
but he's trying to close the gap between us.
So it's a defensive tool that can be used
to close the distance and counterattack.
Which means I have no reason
not to fight from a distance.
Then I wait for my chance, and grab it.
This old man is incredible.
He managed to read my mind in a flash.
I'm guessing I can't capture him alive.
When he shuts the book,
the ability he withdrew also vanishes?
In any case, he's quite talented.
He dodges each of my old man's
attacks at the last second,
leaving me no opening to attack.
He's physically stronger than before.
Since we don't know what abilities he has,
we can't finish him off
without being willing to risk our lives.
Now! Kill him!
A thundering boom resounded
through Yorknew City.
Kurapika had no idea that the shock wave
would lead to an unexpected development.
Brush Your Teeth.

he's tasked with gathering

Hey, what's going on?!
Below us!
There was a huge explosion below us.
Enough waiting around...
I'll see what's happening for myself!
Everyone, please calm down.
I finally managed to contact the Ten Dons.
They wish to speak to you directly.
The auction will proceed,
so please remain calm.
Please enter the auction hall
on the tenth floor.
An underground chamber where everything costs extra.
That is where you will sleep.
Never descend stairs that you didn't first ascend.
Do not compete with others at numbers.
I'll be fine.
This is the tenth floor.
I'll be safe as long as I don't
go down any stairs...
It's all good.
Her fortunes are one hundred
percent accurate.
Her fortunes won't come true
if you heed the warning.
So I'm okay...
Yo, everyone all right?
First, I apologize for taking
so long to make contact.
Sorry.
There's been a lot of chaos,
but it's all cleared up now.
We've dealt with the Phantom Troupe's leader.
It's only a matter of time before
the rest of them are finished.
We're letting the professionals
handle the hunt
so you can enjoy the auction.
Tonight, we'll be watching the auction live,
so let us see some furious bidding.
As you all just heard,
the Ten Dons will be watching a
live feed of the proceedings.
Please concentrate on the auction.
Illumi?
Yeah.
Where is my client?
Right here.
Oh, were you fighting?
Is he still alive?
Just in the nick of time...
That's a relief.
Well, relay a message.
I've killed the Ten Dons.
Tell him to wire the money
to my account as agreed.
Up we go...
Good grief.
It seems we both get to live another day.
Aren't you supposed to kill me?
We were hired by the Ten Dons.
Now that they're all dead,
you are no longer our target.
Really? That's surprising.
You won't get another chance like this.
Do you believe that we kill for pleasure?
We don't do this for fun.
I refuse to work for nothing
or die for nothing.
Did you know that I hired Illumi
to assassinate the Ten Dons?
Of course.
But that's irrelevant.
We simply do the job we're hired for.
I see.
Say, can I ask you something?
If you and I were to fight one-on-one,
who would win?
Most likely, I would win.
Unless you decided to actually try to kill me.
Honestly, you're a cheeky kid.
So he could tell?
What a drag...
I couldn't steal their powers.
So you want us to wait at L Hospital?
Yeah, it's more dangerous
here than anticipated.
We'll send her over by ambulance.
She's just unconscious,
so you shouldn't have to worry.
But she'll be much safer at a hospital.
Make the preparations.
Looks like you had fun, boss...
Yeah.
I'm a little tired now.
You were up against the Zoldyck family.
I wish I could've seen how
those two fought you.
Fighting would be more fun than watching.
Kortopi, everything ready?
Of course.
I can't make living copies,
but I can provide static copies.
Good enough.
Then we'll stick to the plan.
Also...
Don't touch the ambulance that girl is in.
Will we really be safe on the trip over?
If they planned to attack the ambulance,
they would've done so on its way here.
And you shouldn't have to worry
about stray bullets anymore.
It's the moment you've all been waiting for.
We will now begin the auction!
Allow me to introduce our
first item of the night...
I was concerned for a moment.
But all's well that ends well.
And none of the leaders were hurt.
We did well.
Thanks.
Allow me to introduce the next item.
An executioner's blade made of pure gold,
taken from the Yulu Museum
of National Treasures!
Let's start the bidding at 20 million!
40 million!
50 million!
I hear 50 million...
100 million!
I'll put him on autopilot now...
Next, we have the fabled
sacred jar of the Rai Dynasty,
Inspirational Blue.
The last pristine piece left in this world.
Um, Inspirational Blue is...
Over here.
Kortopi, this one is next.
Here, make a copy.
Okay.
Gallery Fake: Divine Left Hand,
Demonic Right Hand
Here comes Inspirational Blue...
Let's start the bidding at 100 million!
200 million!
330 million!
380 million!
Hey, there.
Aren't you going to participate
in the auction?
What do you mean?
The leader of the Troupe was killed.
Why wouldn't they proceed?
Impossible.
It can't be...
We're just mopping up leftovers now.
They're called pros for a reason.
While your useless ass was busy
fussing over an ambulance,
the Zoldycks got the job done.
So you're not needed any longer.
Just stick with your little fortune girl.
Run off to the hospital or the hotel.
Or will you lick the boots
of that old fraud who
failed to score any pointsâ€”
I won't believe it.
Not until I see a body!
This is the boss?
He's young.
Cocky son of a bitch.
Hey, don't touch his head.
We're going to show his
face on the Internet.
We found the other members' bodies!
Okay, I'm on my way.
A total of five bodies?
Try to identify them.
DNA, teeth, fingerprints, disease...
Try everything you can!
You can dismember them,
but don't touch the heads.
Once we have their identities,
we'll kill their parents, siblings,
relatives, and lovers!
We'll make sure no one ever
tries a stunt like this again!
Now, everyone...
It's time for our last item tonight!
One of the world's seven
most beautiful items,
the Scarlet Eyes!
With the Kurta Clan's extinction,
only thirty-six pairs exist.
This particular set has a
particularly brilliant red hue.
Then, let's start the bidding at 100 million!
110 million!
120 million!
130 million!
150 million!
170 million!
Boss? It's Kurapika.
190 million!
I apologize.
200 million!
I predicted incorrectly.
I have 200 million!
The leader of the spiders is dead.
210 million!
220 million!
The auction is proceeding as scheduled.
230 million!
What?
240 million!
The Scarlet Eyes are currently
being auctioned.
250 million!
260 million!
Should I bid on them?
Of course!
270 million!
You must win them.
Is there a limit as to price?
No! Bid as much as it takes!
Win the Scarlet Eyes!
I understand.
300 million!
I hear 300 million!
Anyone else? Do I have any more bids?
350 million!
360 million!
370 million!
390 million!
500 million!
1 billion.
2.9 b-billion?
Yes,
the skinhead who was in the
room with the assassins
put up a fight.
Zenji? Damn him...
I didn't expect to spend
this much, damn it.
Curse that pig.
No matter...
This means that the community
receives more money,
which will benefit my reputation.
As long as I have Neon's fortunetelling,
I can easily make back that money.
It's not a problem.
Well done... Good job.
That's right.
This is an investment in my trek to the top.
In order to succeed,
I must keep Neon happy.
She is my trump card.
She always will be.
As long as I have her...
I can throw money at anything.
You're from the Nostrade Family?
Congratulations on your winning bid.
Is this the item you wanted?
Yeah.
Bastard.
You think you can just walk away?
Tsk...
Stop!
I'll blow your head off!
Move.
Don't be...
Just stop.
I don't care who I kill right now...
Even if it's you.
Who is that guy?
Yeah, I'm getting into this!
How about another?
Seriously...
They were drinking while
we were captured?
Oh, you're back?
Come and drink with us!
Are you an idiot?
We're underage!
And aren't you underage too?
What's your point?
In my country, you can drink
once you're sixteen.
I see.
Really...
I had no idea that happened.
I'm amazed you escaped alive.
The Phantom Troupe's that dangerous?
Back there, one of the tricks
you taught us came in handy.
If the exit is blocked...
Make your own!
I get it.
I'm glad I was able to help in some way.
Experience can sometimes blind you.
A con artist's knowledge might come
in handy against the Troupe.
Exactly!
There's more to being a con
artist than you'd think.
I haven't just been drinking
myself senseless here...
I've been learning a lot from Zepile.
And tomorrow morning,
we'll hit the auction.
You guys are coming, right?
I'd like to, but I have to find Kurapika
and learn about Nen from him.
Kurapika? You got through to him?
Yep, but we're waiting for
him to call us back.
Hold on.
Did you say you need to learn
about Nen from him?
I did.
Why?
He just learned about Nen
recently himself, right?
But Kurapika managed to defeat a
member of the Phantom Troupe.
Seriously?
Yeah.
He must know some secret about Nen.
Some strength that doesn't
require experience or power.
Yay!
Thanks, Daddy!
They're beautiful...
Are you feeling better now?
Uh-huh, I forgive you!
Really?
I'm glad to hear that.
Good work.
My daughter is doing well,
so we'll head back to the hotel.
Tomorrow, we need to buy
the actor's used tissue.
And that will end the auction.
I'll be leaving the morning of
the day after tomorrow.
But I want you to accompany
my daughter as she shops.
Kurapika...
We can handle the remainder
of the auction and shopping.
You should get some rest.
Yes...
Thanks, I think I'll do that.
Is he really okay?
Hello? Kurapika?
Yeah.
You said you wanted to
stop the Troupe, right?
That won't be necessary now.
The spider is dead.
Huh? What do you mean?
Kurapika?!
Oh, a shame.
I'd hoped to provide some comfort.
The Mafia community was nothing special.
We didn't even need Nobunaga.
Shut up!
What'd he say?
The Troupe's dead.
What?!
Seriously?
He hung up.
I have no way to find out any more.
Kurapika is now drowning in
an indescribable emptiness.
Brush Your Teeth.

My horoscope was horrible today.
Oh, there's a Choco Robo here.
Lucky! So much for that horoscope!
﻿Fortunes x Aren't x Right?
Ready, go!
Kurapika!
This is great.
Huh?
The spiders are dead,
so you can finally focus on your main goal.
You have to find the eyes of your people.
Gon...
Yep.
If there's anything we can do to help—
Hey!
You did it first.
I was getting revenge!
But I didn't do it on purpose.
You did it deliberately!
Why are you so upset?
We sold that piece for 355 million Jenny!
It could have sold for more...
We got a decent price!
No, we could have gotten over 400
million if we'd sold at a different time.
We had bad luck...
You sure take this seriously.
It isn't like you would've gotten anything
if we'd gotten a better price.
That's not the issue here.
If we run with the money,
we'd each get a 170 million cut!
Are you really friends with Gon and Killua?
I was joking.
Hello?
Oh, Kurapika!
It's been a while since we
were all together last!
Yeah.
Where's Zepile-san?
He wanted to validate our check
and find more hidden gems to sell.
Anyway...
What?
You've got this intensity about you...
You seem a little more intimidating now.
Really?
You don't seem to have changed much.
And you're more annoying, too!
Oh, I heard that you defeated
a member of the Troupe.
Having only just learned Nen,
how did you manage that?
If you're looking for advice
on catching the spiders,
then stop.
That's not the only reason.
We want to master Nen.
Because we'll definitely
need Nen in the future.
Then you don't want my advice.
It won't do you any good.
Why not?
My power can only be
used against the Troupe.
Huh?
Restraint and vow?
Yeah.
Nen is strongly affected by your mental state.
The stronger your resolve,
the more power you receive.
However, you also incur a
big risk at the same time.
In return for Nen power,
I vowed to use it against the spiders alone.
I established a rule for myself.
What's the rule?
If I use my chains on one who isn't a spider,
I will forfeit my life.
Huh? What do you mean?
There is a Nen blade pointed at my heart.
If I break the rule,
that blade will pierce my heart, killing me.
This is the rule that shows my resolve.
Restraint and vow.
My power is the product of pure hatred.
It only works on the spiders.
I'm telling you because I trust you.
Don't tell anyone else.
Why...
Why would you tell us something so important?!
I'm not sure.
With their leader's death,
I must have relaxed.
It'll be fine if we keep our mouths shut.
It's too dangerous.
One of the surviving members can read minds.
If they find out, Kurapika won't
be able to beat them!
But she didn't learn anything last time.
That's because we didn't know
Kurapika was the chain user.
Then we just have to stay away from them.
They've already checked you,
so they think you're clean.
But there's also a guy called Nobunaga.
He's especially dangerous.
He's looking for Kurapika,
and he's still trying to chase us down.
Is he aware that you guys know Kurapika?
No...
Then it's okay!
As long as no one around the mind reader
knows Kurapika, then you're safe.
Well, I've also been in
contact with Hisoka.
What?!
Hisoka?
He knows that I am the chain user.
We made a pact,
but his target, the leader of
the spiders, is now dead.
So I don't know what he'll do.
What do you mean?
We're leaving?
I mean exactly what I say.
We're departing tonight.
We'll take the rest of the treasure tonight.
That will be the end.
It isn't.
What else is there?
We have to find the chain user.
You seem obsessed.
Yes, I am.
We're going to scatter
without avenging Uvo?
Uvo will be bored in the next
world if we don't send
the chain user to join him.
Cut it out, Nobunaga.
The boss has issued an order.
Yeah, and an order from
the boss is absolute.
But is that really an order from our boss,
Chrollo?
Nobunaga, watch yourself...
Shut up!
I'm talking to Chrollo!
Before I can answer your question...
Nobunaga,
I need you to answer my question.
Nobunaga,
I need you to answer my question.
What's your date of birth?
Huh?
What day were you born?
September 8th, 70.
Blood type?
B.
Name?
Nobunaga Hazama...
You already know that!
The hell is this about?!
What do you want next?
No, that's enough.
Write all of that on this sheet of paper.
Why didn't you tell me to
do that in the first place?
Huh? What's this?
A one hundred percent accurate
fortune written in verse.
The ability to see the future.
I stole this power from Nostrade's daughter.
One hundred percent accurate?
Each of the four verses predicts
what will happen in that week.
The calendar loses a precious component.
The remaining months gather to mourn.
The first moon, having missed his opportunity,
continues to pursue the eleventh moon alone.
The chrysanthemum withers and falls,
to lie on the ground beside bloody Scarlet Eyes.
But the spider does not stop.
Even after losing half its limbs.
This is the fortune his
daughter gave me yesterday.
Is the precious component of the calendar...
Uvo.
That girl didn't know anything about Uvo.
In other words, she predicted our attack
on the Mafia auction.
And there were fans of her
fortunetelling among the Ten Dons.
I get it.
That explains why the merchandise
had already been moved the
first time we attacked.
What does Nobunaga's fortune say?
The pen writes by itself.
I don't know what was written.
Ask Nobunaga.
Well, Nobunaga?
Next week, five of us will probably die.
Which five?
No idea...
I can't interpret this.
I kind of understand the second verse.
The spider loses half its limbs.
The spider would be us?
Yeah.
And the limbs would be the members,
so half would be six.
That means five more after losing Uvo.
The same line was in my fortune.
Let me see.
Boss, can you tell my fortune?
The calendar loses a precious component.
The remaining months gather to mourn.
You join your ally as an offering,
to keep him from being lonely.
You will find eternal rest
in a room filled with black merchandise.
Beware solitude above all.
You have the most to fear when
you are alone with another.
I thought so.
I'm going to die next week.
Seriously?
Yep.
Because I only got two verses.
And Pakunoda and Shalnark will die, as well.
How do you know that?
It seems the numbered months
here refer to Troupe members.
November is the eleventh month.
Uvo was member #11.
Exactly.
The chrysanthemum is the
flower of September.
It blooms in August, the eighth month,
and it withers in June.
This refers to members #6, #8, and #9.
And since the word "falling"
is used, it implies death.
I'm not certain to whom "Scarlet Eyes" refers.
It isn't one of us.
I'm guessing it's the chain user.
Scarlet Eyes...
I remember now.
The clan whose eyes turned red.
Then there was a survivor?
So it seems...
Will he also die?
Hard to say.
It could just mean that he's covered in blood.
Nobunaga, this means we'll
suffer serious casualties
if we fight the chain user!
We'll lose half our members.
You and I have abilities that
can be easily replaced,
but Shizuku and Pakunoda have rare powers.
The Troupe can't afford to lose them.
Today is Saturday of the first week.
If we return home today,
we won't run into the chain user next week.
The advantage of being able
to predict the future
is that we can avoid undesirable prophecies.
If we leave this place without
fighting the chain user,
this fortune is one hundred percent
certain to not come true.
Nobunaga, you and Uvo were
the Troupe's attackers.
To die is just part of your job.
I believe that you both chose
that role voluntarily.
Yeah, that's right...
Shizuku, Paku, and Shal collect intelligence.
They provide our support.
You could say they're our lifeline.
Isn't it your job to serve as their shield?
Yeah, it is!
Wait...
You should tell some of the
other members' fortunes.
Perhaps we could gather additional
clues for avoiding the prophecy.
What do we do?
Now that we know Kurapika's secret,
it's dangerous to wait around.
If Nobunaga captures either Gon or me again,
we probably won't be able to escape.
But we have Kurapika with us now.
We should take them out
before they have a chance
to recover and escape.
We know where their current base is.
If we take too long, they might get away.
We need to move fast.
They could be making an
escape as we speak.
We don't have time for too much thought.
The woman you mentioned
is certainly a threat...
But since their leader is dead,
I'll do as Gon says, and focus on
recovering my brethren's eyes.
Seriously?!
Yeah.
You're sure about this?
Kurapika's made up his mind.
We can't force him to change it.
Sorry, Killua.
Thank you for the valuable information.
It's from Hisoka...
The dead bodies were fakes.
Kurapika?
The dead bodies were fakes...
Huh?
You mean the dead bodies
of the Troupe members?
Yeah, the dead spiders were fakes!
It would be possible for a
Conjurer to accomplish that.
Damn!
Why didn't I realize this sooner?
The situation's changed.
What now?
We're here to help.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Hello?
Kurapika, it's me.
Melody?
What is it?
The community has called off the hunt
for the remaining Troupe members.
What?
We've learned that they
came from Meteor City.
The Troupe comes from Meteor City?
The Ten Dons gave the order directly.
The reward has been rescinded.
The reward has been rescinded?
Seriously?
The Troupe comes from Meteor City.
Makes sense...
That explains why their
identities are still unknown,
and why the cops haven't
been able to catch them.
What's Meteor City?
A city populated by people who,
as far as society is concerned, don't exist.
There's a city like that?
Yeah.
Officially, it's unpopulated,
but it's said that ten million people live there.
It began as a dump over 1,500 years ago.
People began to live off the garbage
that was dumped there.
You're allowed to dump anything there.
From garbage to weapons, and even people.
And the residents
will accept anything left there.
I've heard that Meteor City
residents share a bond
thinner than that between strangers,
stronger than that between family.
Actually, there are those
who provide Meteor City
with weapons and precious metals
under the pretext of garbage.
That would be the Mafia community.
What do you mean?
But the Mafia is hunting the Troupe!
In return, the Mafia recruited
people from Meteor City.
People who didn't exist, as far
as society was concerned.
Perfect for committing crimes.
The Troupe destroyed the
normally intimate relationship
between the Mafia community and Meteor City.
But the Mafia has decided to
prioritize that relationship.
A red-eyed customer will visit your shop,
half angel, half death-bringer.
You would do well to sell
the calendar's secrets.
He will be especially pleased to
learn the eleventh moon's secret.
The customer will return on a hot day,
leaving you alone with a man
bearing St. Peter's cross.
The false fourth moon will be
torn away from the calendar.
Only six pages remain.
What does your fortune say?
Let me see.
I don't recommend it.
It'll give you a shock.
Just let me see it.
Very well.
Look at this, everyone!
"A red-eyed customer will visit..."
"The calendar's secrets..."
That would be our secrets, right?
Hisoka, what is this?
Lemme see!
A red-eyed customer will visit your shop,
seeking to make a trade.
The customer will use the
sword of law upon you,
taking the calendar's secrets with him.
The eleven-legged spider grows homesick,
losing five more legs.
Do not leave your temporary shelter,
for you are one of the remaining legs.
Hisoka...
Did you sell him out?
Sell out Uvo?!
Hisoka's fortune changed when
it was passed to Pakunoda.
What could that mean?
Brush Your Teeth.

His Highness Killua!
Yeah, yeah.
﻿Did you sell him out?
Sell out Uvo?!
I'll take that as a yes...
Outta my way!
Hold on...
Let's hear his explanation.
Explanation?
What is there to explain?
Calm down.
Didn't the boss tell us that prophecies can
be avoided, depending on our actions?
Hisoka, explain what happened this week.
I cannot.
What?!
All I can say is that the first verse was true...
Nothing more.
You hear that?!
Move!
Just hold on.
Hisoka, why can't you explain?
If I were to tell you the reason,
I would be telling you
precisely what I cannot say.
Thus, I cannot say.
It isn't that I won't.
I cannot.
That's all I can let you know.
If you cannot accept my answer,
then in order to defend myself...
I'll have no choice but to fight.
Allies x And x Lies
After seeing Hisoka's fortune,
Nobunaga suspects Hisoka of betraying them,
and draws his sword.
Forget it.
You're impossible to deal with.
As if, you fool!
What?
Nobunaga,
stop talking for a bit.
Huh?
Did the boss do that?
Probably.
Hisoka, I have a few questions for you.
If you're unable to answer, just say so.
A red-eyed customer will visit your shop,
seeking to make a trade.
The customer will use the sword of law upon you,
taking the calendar's secrets with him.
In the fortune, what are
the calendar's secrets?
The powers of the Troupe's members.
Of how many members?
Seven.
No, eight.
The boss and Uvogin,
Shizuku, Machi, Franklin,
Pakunoda, Shalnark, and I add up to eight.
So until yesterday, you didn't
know of Kortopi's ability?
That is correct.
What is our opponent's power?
I cannot say.
What about his appearance?
I cannot say.
What is your relationship to him?
I cannot say.
I understand.
The red-eyed customer, the chain user,
has two abilities at the very least.
One would be the ability he
used to capture Uvogin.
The other would be the ability that
prevents Hisoka from speaking.
seeking to make a trade.
The customer will use the sword of law upon you,
taking the calendar's secrets with him.
Since the fortune uses the
phrase "sword of law,"
the latter must be able to compel
you to follow set rules.
"Do not lie to me."
"Do not give out any information about me."
Something like that.
I would also assume
that he placed something inside Hisoka's body.
A red-eyed customer will visit your shop,
seeking to make a trade.
The customer will use the sword of law upon you,
taking the calendar's secrets with him.
The first half of the verse mentions a trade,
but the second half only describes
what the customer took.
This suggests that the sword
of law would attack Hisoka.
In other words, he traded the
sword's attack for our secrets.
Oh, so lovely...
The sword that can restrict Hisoka's
speech is powerful indeed.
You are magnificent...
I absolutely must be the one to kill you.
Let's review.
We're up against the chain user.
He's either a Manipulator who used
real chains to defeat Uvo,
or a Conjurer who used Nen
chains to defeat him.
Is there a difference?
A big difference.
A Conjurer could walk around unarmed.
That's a huge advantage.
I see.
Conjurers have to exercise their imaginations,
but it's easy to conjure
something you're familiar with.
The problem is the power
that's restricting Hisoka.
Since it's the sword of law, it must
involve rules he has to follow.
Yes, it's very likely that two are the
commands the boss mentioned.
Also, he's probably barred from
attacking the chain user.
And I'd imagine that he'll die
if he breaks those rules.
How amusing.
There is no sword of law in my body...
That fortune was my own creation.
I only revealed the powers of two members.
Not eight.
It was a risky gamble that would have turned
the entire Troupe against me,
if the boss hadn't figured that out.
All to keep the spiders in Yorknew City,
to allow me to fight the boss.
Should we leave Yorknew City,
it's hard to say when I'll see the boss again.
What about Hisoka's second verse?
"The eleven-legged spider grows homesick,
losing five more legs.
Do not leave your temporary shelter,
for you are one of the remaining legs."
If he leaves our temporary shelter, this base,
then Hisoka will die.
What does the homesick part mean?
It refers to our desire to go home.
If we return home, half of us will die.
I get it.
Uvo, Hisoka, Shizuku, Pakunoda, Shalnark.
One more for half the members...
No one else's fortune predicted their death?
Then it has to be Feitan, Kortopi, or me.
We didn't get our fortunes told
because we lacked the data.
I am staying here.
There's something I wish to do before I die.
I will not be leaving our temporary shelter.
Boss, what should we do?
Leave or stay?
Stay.
No.
Huh? Why not?
You were the one who wanted to
capture the Phantom Troupe.
It'd be pointless now.
But why?
With the reward gone, you'd be
taking a big risk for nothing.
Yeah, but capturing the Phantom
Troupe would be worth it!
You're getting your priorities mixed up.
Have you forgotten why we're here?
Greed Island.
Exactly!
The Southern Piece auction begins in two days.
We need to build up our war chest!
Actually, I have a great plan
to get the game.
What's your plan?
It's a secret right now!
Stop being coy, and spit it out...
You're strangling me!
I'm going to die!
Anyway, I'll work something
out for the game.
So for now, let's stick to the Troupe.
Do you really have a plan?
Yep, but it's not guaranteed to work.
How likely is it to work?
Huh?
What percentage do you think
your plan has of working?
Seventy percent.
Seventy?
M-Maybe more like sixty...
So it's a fifty-fifty deal.
That sounds much better than trying
to earn six billion in two days.
Okay, have it your way.
I'll let you handle the game.
But we can't deal with the Troupe alone.
We only move if Kurapika helps us.
Okay.
Boss, where are you going?
Shopping.
I told you earlier.
Basho and I will accompany you.
Can you watch over things here, Squala?
Sure.
I'm saved!
Guard the Scarlet Eyes well.
Yeah.
With these guys helping, I should be fine.
I'm off, then.
Yeah, see you later.
How did it go?
I couldn't get a straight answer.
The community didn't have any updates
regarding the auction today.
You should tell them that
the Troupe is still alive!
Then the Mafia might rethink it.
No, nothing will change.
The community values its
relationship with Meteor City.
It's safe to assume that they will
not attack the Troupe further.
Really?
But that wasn't the information I wanted.
My only concern is whether the
auction will proceed as scheduled...
You're not planning to intercept them, are you?
That's crazy...
How can you confront them
without Mafia support?!
You have it wrong, Leorio.
I never had any help from the Mafia.
Kurapika, let us help.
We're willing to do anything.
Turn him down...
The reward was rescinded.
I know.
I want to stop the Phantom Troupe.
That hasn't changed.
Turn him down...
Turn him down!
You'd be risking your lives.
Come on, that's what he wants to hear.
Okay, let's put together a plan.
Uh-huh.
He agreed?!
First, we'll need someone to watch their base,
and to provide updates.
I can do that.
The target is the woman named Pakunoda.
You can ignore everyone else.
Okay.
Be very careful.
Don't worry, I won't push my luck.
I'll need a driver to accompany me.
Leorio, could you handle that?
Huh?
Y-Yeah...
It'll be fine.
You'll be safe if you're with Kurapika.
Hey, Killua...
Don't make it sound like I
was scared or something!
Kurapika, what about me?
I need you to act as a decoy,
to throw the enemy off.
Got it.
Hold on!
Isn't that a dangerous role?
He'll have to face the Troupe members again!
That depends on our strategy.
Strategy?
What strategy will we use?
A very simple one.
While the enemy is occupied with Gon,
I'll capture Pakunoda and escape by car.
That sounds a little shaky...
There are too many uncertainties
for me to devise a concrete plan.
I'll let Gon decide his strategy.
But I'll need you to draw their attention
for at least half a second...
A full second if at all possible.
One second, then?
Yeah.
Draw their attention away for one second.
Can I do that?
Gon.
You are the key.
Can you handle it?
I'm not sure.
I'll need to think about it.
We have six hours.
If the auction proceeds as scheduled,
the spiders will make their move before then.
Hey,
why are you accepting our help now?
Because the risk I'm taking has increased.
I have to eliminate Pakunoda immediately.
No matter the cost.
He's...
So this is why Kurapika seems so different...
His resolve is even stronger.
Kurapika,
put a Nen blade in me!
A Nen blade?
Gon, weren't you listening?
Kurapika will die if he attacks anyone
who isn't a Troupe member!
Keep your voice down!
Then why is there a Nen
blade in Kurapika's chest?
Kurapika isn't a member of the Troupe.
What I'm about to tell you
will increase my risk further.
Okay.
Hey, Killua...
I'll start with the conclusion.
It is indeed possible.
The five chains have different abilities.
Two of the chains are for attacking spiders.
The first is Chain Jail.
The binded target is
forced into a state of Zetsu.
This power is for capturing the spiders.
And this is my Judgment Chain.
I point a blade at the target's heart,
then state rules that they must follow.
If a rule is broken, the target dies.
As you've figured out,
I pointed a blade at my own heart.
At first, I devised the rule that I would die if I attacked anyone besides a spider
with my chains, and I set a
blade pointed at myself.
But that was when I realized something.
Would using them on myself be
considered a violation of that rule?
It was possible I would be an exception,
but I didn't know for sure.
That's why I adjusted the rule.
I can only use Chain Jail against the spiders.
Meaning that I can use my Judgment
Chain on those who aren't spiders.
But first, a condition must be met.
A condition?
This chain can only be used
when my eyes are scarlet.
You can make your eyes scarlet now?
I had to work at it.
It took a while before I could
deliberately turn them scarlet.
I mastered the power in my middle finger
by vowing to never release this chain,
and to always risk death.
The power in my pinky was
resolved by my unique nature.
When my eyes are scarlet,
I become a Specialist.
And I can use any ability I've
learned at full strength.
I'm not sure what that means,
but you should be able to use
your Nen blade on me, right?
Yes.
Go ahead.
You can choose the rule to set.
I accept your resolve.
Can you make three of those blades?
You can rescind the rule once
our mission is over, right?
Killua! Leorio!
We had a little talk.
And since we're working together...
We should share the same fate.
What do you say?
The answer to both questions is yes.
But you three are wholly mistaken.
I never had any intention of
using my blade on you guys.
Then why endanger yourself
by telling us your secret?
Gon, I wanted...
No, I wanted to thank all
of you for your resolve.
Even if one of you ends up revealing my secret,
I will have no regrets.
I have good friends...
That's not fair, Kurapika.
You're actually putting more
pressure on us this way.
That was my goal.
Oh, I get it now!
That isn't remotely funny!
Well,
I'll head out, then.
Can't waste any time.
Be careful, Killua!
Yeah, I got this.
You will find eternal rest
in a room filled with black merchandise.
Beware solitude above all.
You have the most to fear when
you are alone with another.
On a dark day with very little light,
you will face two choices within a small room.
You must choose between pride and betrayal.
While the death-bringer hovers near.
Do not make any phone calls.
When it matters most, you will
be unable to reach anyone.
It would be unwise to answer the phone,
for the death-bringer will come
calling one time in three.
Let's break into groups.
We'll spend the next week
operating in these groups.
Avoid moving alone.
Shizuku, Pakunoda, and Machi.
Kortopi, Phinks, and Feitan.
Nobunaga and Shalnark are with me.
Bonolenov, Franklin, and Hisoka will stay here.
Boss, can I ask a question?
Some kids know about this place.
Kids?
Well, they didn't have anything
to do with the chain user.
But I'm still worried.
Yeah! I forgot!
Boss, I want to recruit that kid.
Wait, that wasn't why I mentioned them!
Explain.
I see... He does sound interesting.
However, it doesn't sound
like he'll join the spiders.
We can convince him!
Just meet with him.
Boss, don't listen to him.
So, Machi, why the concern?
Um...
It's just a hunch.
Instinct, huh?
You have sharp instincts.
It's possible that there's something
important about those kids.
To be safe, we need more fake bases.
Kortopi, can you make ten more?
I can do another fifty.
And the instant anyone enters
a fake base, I'll know.
My copies function as En.
Something isn't right...
Am I in the wrong place?
No, that's impossible.
It can't be!
There are more buildings now!
As rain comes pouring down,
the operation to capture
Pakunoda commences.

Bow!
Gon.
Wow!
﻿That is most likely a Conjurer's work.
Yeah, that's gotta be it.
These buildings weren't here yesterday.
This has to be Nen.
Man, these guys are really crazy...
They have someone who can
conjure entire buildings!
It's safe to assume that
they're rigged somehow.
Yeah.
That tells us they're still using
this place as their base.
The problem is
that these buildings create
too many blind spots.
I can only watch twenty
percent of the area at a time.
However,
if you move around too much,
you could run into one of them.
I'd like to avoid that.
I mean,
I have no idea what I'd do if I
heard their voices behind me...
My heart is pounding.
Voices?
Huh?
Oh, never mind. I read you.
For now, return to your original position.
I'll call you back in five minutes.
Hello? Melody?
How's it going on your side?
We're still shopping.
Let me see that one.
This might be harder than
regular bodyguard work.
It's not too bad...
Basho's about to snap.
Let's go back to the other store.
Yes, I know.
Beloved x And x Beleaguered
You've already told me everything that Uvo
knew about the chain user?
Yeah, when we were investigating
the Nostrade Family using the Hunter website,
Uvo pointed to three members at the top.
It was late night on the 1st when we realized
they were the daughter's bodyguards.
And I met that daughter yesterday.
And that's when you stole her power.
Yeah.
And here is an updated list of bodyguards.
There are two new members.
Wow.
They already have new information up?
Seven bodyguards...
Perhaps more.
That's a lot of people to guard one girl.
He must love his daughter.
He probably cares more about her ability.
Her father achieved his current
status by using her power.
There are many who resent his advancement.
But why did she come to Yorknew City?
For the auction, I'd imagine.
Boss?
Shizuku, Pakunoda...
Yes?
Nice...
Actually, I'm an idiot.
Damn, what's wrong with me?
If I'd stopped to consider why their
boss's daughter is in Yorknew City,
we could have found the chain user sooner.
It's safe to assume that this
girl came to Yorknew City
for the auction.
I was too focused on her fortunetelling
to give any regard to that.
According to the website,
this girl also collects body parts.
Body parts...
The Scarlet Eyes!
Yes.
The chain user joined the
Nostrade Family for a reason.
He knew that the Scarlet Eyes
would be sold at the auction,
and that Nostrade's daughter
would be interested in them.
The chain user desires two things.
To exact revenge upon us,
and to recover his people's eyes.
Shal, were we able to steal the Scarlet Eyes?
Sorry, I'm not sure.
I had the auctioneer running on
autopilot throughout the auction.
Kortopi, do you remember
copying the Scarlet Eyes?
I copied them.
Your copies function as En.
Can you tell where the copy is?
If I'm touching the real one.
Found them.
Got it.
There's something of the same shape
approximately 2,500 meters in that direction.
Is the chain user there?
We should hurry.
The En effect will fade in a few hours.
Do you have a map?
Here.
North-northwest...
2,500 meters.
Hotel Beitacle.
Boss...
Let me go.
Please.
Very well.
But I shall accompany you.
Yes, sir.
Paku, Machi, Shizuku,
you're coming, too.
Shal, you'll switch with Kortopi.
Okay.
Hello?
Oh, Killua-kun?
Yeah, who are you?
One of Kurapika's colleagues.
Could you look to your left?
Hang up,
and then whisper a command to me.
Raise your right hand.
Her ears are super sharp!
We can use this to our advantage.
What?
Didn't we already try this place before?
Hotel Beitacle is one of the places
where the Nostrade Family is staying.
Yeah, but when Shal checked the website,
they'd already checked out.
They probably checked into that
hotel under a different name.
They're being cautious.
The rain keeps me from
hearing what's being said,
but people are talking over there.
Judging by the footsteps,
five or six, including women.
They're heading in the opposite
direction from those ruined buildings.
That's amazing.
Gon and I have trained hard,
but I can't hear a thing.
This happens to be my power.
Kurapika must be getting desperate...
He actually asked me for help.
Huh?
He wants to do everything himself, right?
Oh...
Yeah, that's true.
Are you an assassin?
I used to be.
How did you know?
Your footsteps.
You're right next to me, but they're estinto.
Es-what?
Estinto...
A music term meaning barely audible.
Oh, I'm in the habit of moving
without making any sound.
You have the quietest step I've ever heard.
Your technique is impressive.
I can see why Kurapika would rely on you.
Well, I'm not too thrilled about this.
Oh? Really?
Stop.
They're one hundred meters
around the next corner.
You can pick out their footsteps?
Everyone's are slightly different.
Oh...
I'll take a look.
Killua?
The woman's here.
She's with her buddies.
There are six, moving together.
That topknot guy's here, too.
One more thing.
There's one person that
wasn't there yesterday.
He's probably the leader.
Can you describe him?
He's wearing a black coat,
with St. Peter's cross on the back.
He has combed-back black hair.
I can't see his face.
And they're too alert!
I'm too afraid to circle around in front.
Let me speak to him.
Where are you now?
In front of the Motoba Building.
They're walking west,
on Continental Street.
There's a station nearby.
Can you make it onto their train?
It depends on the circumstances.
If it's busy, I can manage.
Leorio, take us south.
Okay!
Melody's in the same car as they are.
This train's headed toward Castor.
I'm in the last car.
Castor...
The auction site's that way.
So is our hotel...
Yeah. Yeah.
I know, Eliza.
I'm sick of this job!
I should be happy I get to
spend time with the dogs?
Well, it beats taking care of
that spoiled brat, I guess.
I'm fond of Neon-sama,
but she's too active for me.
Look at this, Eliza!
It's so cute!
Well, hang in there a little longer.
I'll find a better job soon enough...
Who's there?
Room service.
Leave it in front of the door.
Okay, let's eat.
Man, I seriously need to
find a different job...
I don't have the energy for this.
But I need a job that will support
Eliza and these guys...
That's hard to find...
Huh?
Don't worry.
I'll figure something out.
They got off?
They got off at Liber Station.
They're headed toward the
Saloma Department Store exit.
That's not good.
The hotel's that way.
Seriously?!
They know we switched rooms?
Damn, this isn't funny!
We need to escape fast!
I have to bring these.
The station's over there.
Shouldn't we get closer?
No.
If we get any closer,
they might sense my animosity.
Gon,
the range I should stay at
is the distance from here
to the station entrance.
I must attack from this distance
if I don't want to be noticed.
It will take approximately 0.5
seconds to land an attack.
That's more than enough
time for them to evade it.
Unless they're distracted...
Spiders!
They're on the move.
Descending slowly.
An elevator.
Are they going out?
We should hurry, boss.
We'll apprehend him as a group.
Stay close enough to provide assistance.
Pakunoda,
once we capture him,
get the information on Uvo.
Got it.
After that, Nobunaga,
he's all yours.
Go!
They're running toward the hotel.
They're fast!
Can we get there faster by car?
It's rush hour.
They might be faster on foot.
Kurapika!
Wait here until I contact you.
Wait, Kurapika...
I have a good idea.
Kurapika!
Melody and I are at the station entrance.
Those six ran off to the northwest.
Yeah, I'm following them!
Wait, you're running after them?
That's dangerous!
They'll notice you!
Stop it!
Hey!
The bastard hung up on me...
Wow! What's that?
They're ninjas...
Target moving forty kilometers
per hour, in a 2:00 direction.
He got in a vehicle.
I was going to wait until I found another job,
but that's no longer an option.
I'm quitting today!
Leorio, where's Gon?
He ran after Kurapika.
I was told to wait,
but I can't just sit around.
I'm driving to Hotel Beitacle,
but I'm stuck in traffic!
Fine!
We're going after Kurapika!
Seriously...
These people just do whatever
the hell they want!
We're being followed.
When did that happen?
Oops.
I was too focused on chasing the target.
Is the chain user behind or in front of us?
Nobunaga, Pakunoda, and Kortopi,
pursue the target ahead.
Roger that.
Did you see them?
I only caught a silhouette.
I couldn't see their faces,
but one is in the alley.
Another is behind the dumpster.
Okay.
Keep using Gyo.
Yes, sir.
Spiders...
Come and get it!
Stop it, Kurapika.
We can't fight three of them
if they know we're here!
Okay, then it's all or nothing.
Gon?!
Sorry!
I'll stop following, so can you let me go?
Him again?
This is the boy he mentioned?
The other one's here, too.
Show yourself.
What do you want?
The Mafia who put a reward on us are gone.
Wh-What? Really?
Why?
What do we do, boss?
Tie them up.
Phinks? It's me.
I need you to come to the Beitacle Hotel.
Shouldn't we just kill them?
No, I trust your instincts.
If they're connected to the
chain user somehow,
we should keep them alive.
I wouldn't trust my instincts...
I have a question for you.
How can you kill people who
have nothing to do with you?
You look pretty hostile,
considering that you just surrendered.
Why, indeed?
Because they have nothing to do with us?
No.
On second thought, it isn't that simple.
How to verbally express our motives...
I'm not fond of it.
But oddly enough...
Or perhaps it's not that odd.
Is that the key to understanding myself?
What's he talking about?
Head to the hotel, and wait
for Phinks and the others.
If they try to escape, kill them.
Understood.
Now that they're on the alert,
we have to keep our distance,
or they'll notice us.
Make sure you're concealing your presence.
Damn!
You must be patient.
I understand!
You don't understand!
Your reckless pursuit exposed
them to needless danger.
Do you know why they let
themselves be captured?
If you're caught here,
no one will be able to stop the Troupe!
I'm sorry...
Humans have to lower their
guard at some point.
It's an endurance test.
We must wait.
Yeah.
Where's Squala?
He isn't answering his phone.
It isn't the chain user.
No.
He was on the list.
Get out.
I'm pretty good at my job.
I've survived some tight spots.
There's a sort of gut instinct that
works only in those times.
And mine tells me that this...
...is where I'll...
If you move an inch, I'll cut you down.
I have a few questions,
so answer them honestly.
One of your fellow bodyguards
uses chains, right?
Where is he now?
What are you talking about?
Who are you people?!
Do you realize that I'm with
the Nostrade Family...
Answer the question.
I'll break your left arm next.
Hey!
I told you not to move.
Stand perfectly still, and answer her questions.
What happened to Uvogin?
I'm talking about the huge man you captured.
What?
He escaped!
I don't know what happened after that!
Where are your fellow bodyguards?
They already went back to the island.
I was on my way back!
You shouldn't lie...
It's the truth.
Why would I lie in this situation?
Let me ask you one more time.
Where is the chain user?
I don't know who you're talking about.
None of the bodyguards uses chains!
One last question.
Is there someone for whom
you care deeply?
I wouldn't have chosen
this job if there were!
So her name's Eliza...
She's pretty.
If...
If you lay one finger on Elizaâ€”
I warned you not to move...
Twice.
Did you get any data on the chain user?
Naturally.
It's too much trouble to explain,
so I'll shoot the information into you.
With my Memory Bomb.
Recollection Bullet
Recollection Bullet
Memory Bomb
If you're concerned, I'll stop.
Are you stupid? Hurry up.
I see...
So that's what you look like, Kurapika-san.
I won't forget your name
and face until I kill you!
The Phantom Troupe has finally
identified Uvogin's killer.
Kurapika races to rescue Gon and Killua.
The final battle draws near.
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
Coming up, we have Gon
and Killua's
Hunterpedia!
It's Gon
and Killua's
Hunterpedia!
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
Today, we introduce Nobunaga.
A Phantom Troupe member.
An Enhancer.
An iaido master, who can use En
An Enhancer.
He likes Gon and Killua,
in a four-meter radius.
He focuses aura in his sword, to strike down foes
and wants to recruit
them into the Troupe.
with a single blow.
Single blow?
Low blow!
Next time: Initiative x And x Law.
The keyword is dark adaptation.
Do you know?
Look it up in a dictionary.
﻿We didn't learn what happened to Uvo,
but we have the chain user's name and face.
We still don't know his abilities.
All right.
We'll be waiting in the Hotel Beitacle lobby.
It sounds like we got the
chain user's identity.
He has three remaining allies.
Let's go.
Let's go.
What do we do?
There isn't any point in
capturing Pakunoda now.
If I were Kurapika, I would switch targets.
If I wanted to crush the Troupe,
I would target the boss.
Melody's listening in on the conversation,
so they should know where we're going.
It's a question of when he'll attack.
We'll need to confer before we move.
The first instant will decide it.
Any slight delay could cost us our lives.
Initiative x And x Law
Wait here.
They're too alert...
They'll be watching anyone who walks in.
I hope Kurapika and Melody
arrived before us.
Hey!
Do you realize what time it is?!
Idiot! It's Hotel Beitacle!
How many times do I have to repeat myself?
Leorio!
What are you looking at, eh?
Should I get rid of him?
Ignore him.
Don't look at him.
Eh? This ain't no show!
Damn, my future's dark
because of the failures working for me!
Listen up!
This once, I'll close my eyes
like nothing happened.
One more mistake, and you'll get it good!
Now listen.
Seven on the dot.
You'd best be at the hotel by then!
That's a message!
Seven on the dot!
Use darkness to our advantage!
I can escape these threads instantly
by dislocating my fingers.
I'll need 0.7 seconds to attack.
I'll have plenty of time!
It'll take a few seconds before
their eyes adjust to the dark
if the lights suddenly go out!
It's time for our last song.
This request comes from Kicchomu-san.
Three more minutes!
Paku and the others are here.
Oh?
What's this? You got caught again?
I get it...
You changed your minds and
decided to join, right?
We didn't know that the reward
for you guys was rescinded.
So you screwed up again while stalking us?
Didn't learn your lesson, huh?
But this must be fate at work.
Two more minutes.
Well, let's be friends.
No way.
We were only following you for the reward.
I wouldn't even want to look at your faces.
Smart!
Now we won't seem suspicious
when we close our eyes.
I agree.
Well, boss?
They've got guts, right?
Their sass reminds me of Uvo.
That's probably because they're kids.
They know no fear.
Anyway, describe the chain user for us.
First things first, Paku.
Check these kids again.
Okay, what do you want to know?
What are they hiding?
Damn, that's a smart question.
Straight to the point,
and he can learn all kinds
of information from it.
Well, there's only one minute left
in this week's broadcast.
One minute! We have to buy time!
It's no use.
Your power
lets you draw out memories
from those you touch, right?
We aren't hiding anything,
and we know no—
I'll know the truth soon enough.
Shut up.
Even if we did know something,
we could think about something else,
and hide it from you!
Yep, there you go.
You seem to be confused.
I draw out the purest essence of human memory.
I'm not browsing through
the images in your mind.
My question will stimulate your memory,
stirring up the dirt collected in its depths
like throwing a stone into a pond.
The dirt represents your pure,
unaltered memories.
And I simply scoop them up.
It's impossible to deceive me.
I'll see you next week.
This is JFN, and it's 7:00 PM.
Here it comes!
Now, it's time to ask my question.
What are you hiding?
I can see them!
And they can't see us!
The kid on the right is free?
I can't see!
This was their plan?
I won't let go of the other one!
Gon!
To break the thread, I'll have to kill her!
I can't pull out my hand...
She trapped it with her muscles!
You're mine.
Once you reveal your presence,
I can sense you.
Using the dark was meaningless.
Killua!
Give up.
A pity...
Well, it was a good shot.
It came from the entrance?
The guy with the radio was
working with them.
Forget him!
We only need these two.
Our eyes will adjust shortly.
Yes.
Wait, where's the boss?
The boss is gone...
Shizuku, hold this guy for me.
Sure.
Paku, are you okay?
He broke my left hand and a molar...
We underestimated them.
Anyway, this is going to shock you.
These kids are—
Wait!
Pakunoda, this is for you.
Discuss their memories, and I'll kill him.
Hey, what's going on?
We missed him because he was
disguised as a receptionist!
And, wait... the boss should have
been able to evade a chain
attack from that distance.
But the abrupt plunge
into darkness delayed his reactions.
This was all planned out!

And there's one more question...
If these kids knew the chain user all along,
why didn't my previous questioning
trigger any memories?
He must have been hiding his powers
from his own allies!
From all that, we can surmise
that he is most likely intelligent,
quick on his feet, secretive,
and level headed.
He probably isn't bluffing.
He was prepared to sacrifice a few
seconds to leave this message.
Which means the message must be true.
His ally can read human emotion
by listening to heartbeats.
That ally is the reason he
left this message behind.
If I talk, he'll sacrifice his own
allies and kill the boss.
But that also means that these
kids are valuable as hostages.
Paku.
We have a chance to rescue the boss.
Paku...
But...
Paku!
Don't say a word.
Got it?
Machi, focus on your threads.
I'll take him for you.
Kurapika pulled it off.
Since he left us a message,
he'll contact us again.
Until then, these kids are valuable hostages.
I am the head,
and you are the legs of the spider.
Natural law dictates that the
legs blindly follow the head.
However, this simply represents
a chain of command.
It doesn't apply to my life or death.
If I happen to die, one of you can replace me.
And there may come a time when a leg
has more importance than the head.
Make the right call.
My orders are top priority.
However, I am not your top priority.
Our goal is not to keep an individual alive,
but the spider.
Never forget that.
What should we do in this situation?
If I tell everyone the chain
user's powers and weaknesses
that I learned, we can defeat him.
With ease.
But that will probably lead
to the boss' death.
Uvo must have faced a similar decision.
He died for the spider.
Died?
What did that fortune from the boss say?
On a dark day with very little light,
you will face two choices within a small room.
You must choose between pride and betrayal.
While the death-bringer hovers near.
Two choices...
Would it be considered betrayal to speak?
Or would it be considered betrayal to lie?
It is the spider that must be kept alive.
Right...
I'm thinking too hard.
Paku,
don't worry about it too much.
Just keep your mouth shut.
Hurry, Phinks!
The boss has been captured!
Boss...
We still need you.
Even if it means
I must betray the spider.
It's okay.
A number of the enemies were injured.
They won't move until reinforcements arrive.
What are you looking at?
Nothing.
I didn't expect the chain user to be a woman.
Did I say that I was?
You shouldn't let appearances deceive you.
Anyway, you should watch what you say.
Since it may be the last
thing out of your mouth.
You won't kill me.
You left your precious friends behind.
I'm not so composed that
I will ignore your taunts!
Kurapika!
That's enough.
The girl's fortune didn't mention this.
Therefore, this event
isn't significant enough to matter.
You bastard!
Kurapika!
If you kill him, I'll kick your ass!
Do you need further explanation?
I consider this situation
the same as an afternoon coffee break.
A peaceful outing.
Calm down, Kurapika!
We're on equal footing now!
Nothing has changed.
Equal footing?
You are sorely mistaken.
First of all, you've made
the wrong assumption.
I have no value as a hostage.
If you insist on babbling...
He isn't lying.
Everything he says is true.
There you go.
This is reality.
You people are the ones on the ropes.
What do you mean?
His heartbeat is normal.
He isn't shaken by any of this.
He isn't worried or frightened of death.
I can hear that he's accepted death.
I can hear that he walks
with death every day.
How is he capable of producing such a sound?
No more!
I can't take any more of this!
I don't want to listen to you or him!
Melody...
He truly believes that he has
no value as a hostage.
But the fact remains that he is the leader.
What are you...
What are you people?
The spider.
Explain.
The lights went out.
The boss was taken in that instant.
Here's the message from the chain user.
Why didn't you go after him immediately?
Machi and Paku were injured.
So?
He has allies who are pro Hunters.
So?
Read between the lines!
It proves we can use these kids as hostages.
If we give chase and let
them escape, it's over!
The boss has probably been captured
by those chains that Uvo couldn't break.
It'll be difficult for him to escape on his own!
Probably?
The lights went out!
By the time our eyes adjusted,
the boss was gone.
We weren't in any condition to move.
Okay, we can assign blame later.
For now, we need a plan.
Five years ago, were you the
leader when the Troupe
slaughtered the Kurta of the Scarlet Eyes?
Answer me!
Are those the chains you used to kill Uvo?
What were Uvo's last words?
I don't remember.
You're lying.
Am I right, miss?
I can relate.
I feel the same way.
I have nothing to say to you.
Kurapika, he's trying to provoke you!
Don't fall for it!
Damn...
Damn!
Damn!
That proves it.
I'm quite surprised.
The chain user has an exploitable weakness.
I can use this.
It's the boss.
Hello?
I have three demands.
The chain user?
The general rule is that my
demands are absolute.
If you don't obey, I will kill
your leader immediately.
First, do not follow me.
Second, do not harm your two hostages.
Third, put that Pakunoda woman on the phone.
Can I ask you something first?
It's about the second demand.
The two hostages put up a struggle,
and we had to break a few bones.
Then we're done negotiating.
What is it?
Sorry, I was lying.
Both of them are unharmed.
This is your last chance.
Do not fool around.
Put Pakunoda on the phone.
Ow!
Hello?
You are the only one allowed
to hear what I say.
Move away from the others.
Did you make contact with
a man named Squala?
Yes.
Are you aware of a woman named Melody?
I am.
Then this will be quick.
Listen carefully.
You are forbidden from
communicating with your comrades.
No talking, gesturing, writing,
signaling, or making eye contact.
None of that is allowed.
You must come alone to
the place I designate.
If your heart rate changes even in
the slightest, I will kill the hostage.
Understood?
Now give the phone to someone
besides the previous man.
I'm here.
I'm going to meet with Pakunoda alone.
The rest of you must return to your hideout.
All ten Troupe members must be there.
If a single one is missing, I will kill the hostage.
Understood?
Yeah.
Put Pakunoda back on.
Here.
You're to come to Lingon Airport.
You have until 8:00.
And you must come alone.
Don't hesitate, Pakunoda.
Bring everyone.
He'll put his friends before his mission.
Hey, Paku!
Wait!
Let Paku go by herself.
We're returning to the hideout.
Orders from the chain user.
What's your point?
If we disobey, he'll kill the boss!
Are you an idiot?
If that happens, we kill the chain user.
And that will be the end.
It's what the boss would tell us to do.
Nobunaga, you insult the spider.
We have to follow Pakunoda now.
This is an absolute necessity!
I concur.
There's no point in letting Paku go alone.
If we continue to follow his orders,
the fortunes will come true.
I agree with Nobunaga.
We should follow his orders for now.
I agree.
For now?
How long do we listen to him?
Until half our limbs are gone?
Shizuku, what do you think?
When there's a fight, we flip a coin.
He's broken the rules.
But I'll side with Nobunaga.
I don't want the boss to die now.
I don't want Paku to die, either.
I'm sure Paku feels the same way.
That's why she left without a word.
I don't believe this...
Talking to you is pointless.
I would love to kill you right now,
but following Pakunoda comes first.
Wait!
Take one more step,
and I'll cut you down.
Go ahead and try.
Troupe members aren't allowed to fight.
Aren't you on Nobunaga's side?
That's what my heart says.
But the rules are absolute.
If we reject the rules, we reject the spider.
And we also reject the boss.
I don't want to do that.
It's him.
I'll take it.
Hello—
Put one of the hostages on the phone.
You little...
Here.
Are they all together?
They are right now.
But they're talking about
going after Pakunoda...
Watch your mouth, kid.
Hello?
You have thirty minutes to
return to your hideout.
You can try trickery if you want,
but your leader will die.
I'll call again shortly.
We won't be able to follow Paku now.
Damn it!
The boss will die if we ten aren't together?
He's pretty smart to use the
hostages as messengers.
This is the perfect chance to fight the boss.
But if I leave, the boss will die.
There you have it.
Lend me a hand.
Sure.
I've known you a little longer than Chrollo.
Kurapika's revenge has come to fruition.
And his confrontation with the
Troupe has reached its final stage.
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit
Coming up, we have Gon
and Killua's
Hunterpedia!
It's Gon
and Killua's
Hunterpedia!
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
Today, we introduce Pakunoda.
A Phantom Troupe member.
A Specialist.
Her power lets her see memories
A Specialist.
by touching people and objects.
Her rare ability shows her
the memories of the people
or objects she touches.
She can conjure those memories or her own
into bullets to shoot.
Memory Bomb!
Next time: Signal x To x Retreat.
What are you doing, Killua?
Time to retreat.
﻿Now, for verification...
Are you Pakunoda, from the Troupe?
Of course.
She's telling the truth.
I will present each of you with two conditions.
If you abide by them,
I will release your leader.
Pay attention, Pakunoda.
He's more concerned about his friends
than killing me for his vengeance.
That is the chain user's weakness!
Signal x To x Retreat
I'll begin with the leader.
First, you are forbidden to use Nen.
Second...
Am I certain about this?
If I eliminate the boss,
the spider will fall apart.
That was the whole idea.
But...
I have no value as a hostage.
Everything he says is true.
But the spider can move,
even without a head.
The leader isn't absolute...
If necessary, the group is
willing to abandon its leader.
That is the nature of the Phantom Troupe.
I can disable their leader,
but that won't cripple the Troupe!
However, is there any alternative?
Is there some kind of miracle
that can get me out of this bind?!
There isn't.
I can think of nothing...
Yes, this is right.
Right now, this is what I should do.
I must get them back.
That is my top priority!
I don't want to lose
any more friends!
Second, you may not contact
any member of the Troupe.
Those are the two conditions.
And to make certain that you adhere to them,
I will use my Judgment Chain,
the Arbiter Little Finger, on your leader.
You decide if this is acceptable, Pakunoda.
Okay.
You're next, Pakunoda.
First,
release Gon and Killua unharmed,
before midnight, without any tricks.
Second, you may not speak
a single word about me.
If you have no objections,
I will use my chain on you.
Okay.
If Gon and Killua were being
controlled by a Manipulator,
could you tell from their heartbeats?
It's certainly possible.
I've met Killua-kun, and I know how
his normal heartbeat sounds.
So I could tell if anything had changed.
That's good enough.
I have something to say before the exchange.
Kurapika...
In the back of your mind,
you sense that something is amiss.
Why did she come alone?
If the Troupe were as merciless as expected,
this deal would be impossible.
You people are the ones on the ropes.
Their rules are ironclad,
and their boss accepts them.
But what about the others?
This woman appears to be different.
This woman you despise
with everything you have
is driven by the same motive that drives you.
She wishes
to save her companion, her boss.
You must have realized this.
Start by returning to your companions.
Inform them of the hostage exchange.
I want you to bring the hostages to
Lingon Airport before midnight.
Bring no one else.
Tell no one where you're going.
Very well.
You have a deal.
Take me back to the airport.
Why haven't you asked any questions?
You know who I am, don't you?
You aren't worried?
You don't find this deal unreasonable?
Do you truly believe I'll return your leader?
Yes.
You wouldn't ask those questions
if you intended to deceive me.
Does he really expect us to
accept those conditions?
Tell us where he is, Pakunoda.
We'll kill the kids, then deal
with the chain user.
You're insisting?
I insist.
If you don't tell us, I won't let you leave.
I refuse to tell you where he is,
and I am taking the kids alone.
Don't interfere.
Interfere?
Who's the one interfering with our plans?!
Go, Pakunoda.
We'll stop them.
Stop us?
Are you trying to insult us?
You're serious?
I don't get it.
Have you lost your minds?
I bet they were defeated by the
chain user before we arrived.
They're probably under his control.
This is a waste of time.
I'll make them talk.
Is it really so hard to understand?
You don't understand why Pakunoda
wants to leave without a word?
You don't understand why
Machi is stopping you?
You honestly think they're being controlled?
They want to rescue your boss!
Is it so hard to understand
the desire to save a friend?
Shut up, kid!
Are you that desperate to be spared?
I'm not doing this for my sake.
Take back those words!
Good grief.
I refuse.
If you've a problem, come here.
The second you take a step,
I'll rip your head off.
Then I won't budge an inch!
Kurapika isn't like you.
No matter how much he hates someone,
he wouldn't lose control and
kill them without mercy.
If he makes a promise,
he will definitely keep his word!
After meeting him in person,
Pakunoda knows this.
If you follow his conditions,
he'll return your boss!
That's enough, kid...
Don't think you can say anything you want!
That's enough.
Let Pakunoda go.
You're siding with them?
Shal,
right now, what would our
worst-case scenario be?
The boss is already dead,
Pakunoda and the others are being controlled,
we can't find the chain user,
and the two kids escape...
Then, you've got it wrong.
The worst-case scenario would be that
we all die and the spider perishes.
By comparison, your scenario
would be quite pleasant.
Am I wrong?
N-No, you're right.
I don't care about your reasons.
You're being too reliant on the boss.
If the Troupe falls apart as a result,
that's the greatest betrayal you
could make toward the boss.
If we keep bickering, that could well happen.
Cool off.
Let them have their way...
Pakunoda can take the kids.
If the boss doesn't return,
we kill the members being controlled,
and start to rebuild the spider.
It's extremely simple.
I'm fine with that.
If that's what it takes to satisfy you.
Well, I'm not being controlled,
and it won't be easy to kill me.
Hello?
Put the hostages on the phone.
Don't break it!
Are you okay?
Are they there?
Yeah, they're all here.
Hey!
We're following your orders.
Aren't you going to follow them?
The chain user can't monitor our location now.
Shut up.
If I give chase, you'll all stop me.
For now, I'll just sit and wait.
If the boss fails to return, I'll kill you, too.
Go ahead.
Board the waiting airship.
The pilot already has his orders.
As promised, it's just the three of them.
We can't be sure until the airship takes off.
Stay alert.
There's someone over there.
That's
Hisoka!
Hi...
Why are you here?!
Did you sneak out?
No need for concern...
I left a dummy behind.
Hurry up.
Without needles, I can only change
my face for four to five hours.
What are you up to?
Allow me on the airship with them.
If you refuse, I'll kill Gon and Killua.
Bastard...
Just kidding.
That would be such a waste.
My target is the boss.
Once he's released, I'll get off the airship.
I want to fight him.
That's all I want.
Killua, place the phone next to your heart.
It's fine, nothing's wrong with him.
Okay, let's begin the exchange!
If you talk to or make any contact
with a Troupe member, you die.
Now you will get to experience the pain
of losing your home.
I've waited a long time for this moment.
Now...
Let's do this.
I no longer need this.
This won't be considered an internal spat now,
so you needn't hold back.
I see.
You aren't a Troupe member,
so we can talk.
I can't fight you.
Rather, I'm not worth fighting.
He used his Judgment Chain on my heart.
I can no longer use my Nen.
We can leave.
Oh...
Hisoka returned to the airship without fighting.
The leader realized that Hisoka
wasn't a Troupe member,
so he explained about my chains.
I'm not surprised that Hisoka wasn't interested
in fighting someone without Nen.
He wasn't a Troupe member?
No.
How did you sneak out?
I have a friend who's good with disguises.
Don't worry.
I no longer have any reason to kill Chrollo.
I'm not interested in broken toys.
"You can slip out now..." There.
That's right.
My real fortune mentioned
I would have a date with the boss on Tuesday.
And when I left,
the Troupe was supposed to be
down to half its members.
Fate appears to be changing, bit by bit.
I'm sorry for putting you in danger.
Nah...
You used your chains on the boss, right?
Yeah, but...
This isn't the end.
Meow.
Where's the boss?
He won't be coming here.
Don't mess with me.
Explain yourself!
Depending on your response...
Don't worry.
In return...
I can only shoot six bullets at once.
That's enough for the
remaining founding members.
Feitan.
Phinks.
Machi.
Nobunaga.
Shalnark.
Franklin.
Do you trust me?
Paku, you can't mean to...
Hey, are you being controlled by—
Phinks!
Have some faith.
It's Paku.
My memories...
My feelings...
I pass them all to you.
Please...
Let all this
end with me...
Paku.
She's dead.
What's going on?
Let me explain.
I understand everything.
Pakunoda was...
I hope Kurapika's fever doesn't break.
Yeah...
Wait, did you just say what I think you said?
Kurapika shouldn't fight the Troupe anymore.
I thought of something when Kurapika
told me about his powers.
If he'd just wanted revenge,
he would have chosen different abilities.
Really?
If he'd only wanted to kill them,
he wouldn't have gone to the
trouble of chaining their hearts.
Maybe if he only had one target.
But Kurapika's dealing with the entire Troupe.
Even if he captures one,
he can't kill them right away.
And he needs to extract information
about the other members.
Oh...
Personally,
I think his powers were meant
specifically for revenge.
Oh...
But that was his original objective.
Kurapika is different now.
I have good friends...
But you do have a point.
I'd prefer him to stay still for a while.
If their boss doesn't come back,
they'll be even more
determined to find Kurapika.
Yeah.
We'll have to be extremely careful
when we go to the auction house.
So, do you really have a plan for
obtaining a copy of Greed Island ?
Your plan is all we have to go on!
Y-Yeah, but it's a fifty-fifty deal.
Originally, didn't you say it had
a seventy percent chance?
I get it... That's clever.
Actually, that may be our only shot.
Realistic and sound.
I think it has an eighty percent chance!
Really?
Yeah, we can make it work!
The auction is in Hall B.
That way. Over there.
Wow!
Huh?
Why are they here?
How would I know?!
Hey, that was cold.
No need to run away.
Why wouldn't we run away?
Don't worry.
We're not going to kill you.
Because we can't kill the chain user now.
Huh? What do you mean?
Huh?
Didn't he use his chains on the boss?
That means we can't kill him.
Why not?
Isn't it the other way around?
It's pretty useful to have someone
who's willing to ask questions.
Nen doesn't necessarily disappear after death.
Nen that's driven by hatred and regret
can persist a long time after death.
That Nen will direct itself toward
the target of those emotions.
Since the boss can no longer use Nen,
he could be overwhelmed by that assault.
Residual Nen can be quite fearsome.
That's why we can't kill the chain user.
I'm talking too much?
I know.
I won't say another word.
There are Nen users
who can remove other people's Nen.
East, huh...
So, we're done with you kids.
We just came to enjoy the auction.
The other members wanted to go home.
Um, what happened to Pakunoda-san?
She died.
Huh?
Oh...
Why don't you run away?
Run away?
Given my injuries, you should
be able to escape.
If you did, I would lose my leverage,
and the chain user could kill the boss.
So why don't you run away?
Aren't you on his side?
Because we're his friends.
Because we're his friends,
we don't want him to kill.
So we'd prefer this to be
settled with an exchange.
What's wrong?
Let's go.
Paku...
Paku wanted to thank you.
Next week, the story moves
into the Greed Island arc.
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit
Coming up, we have Gon
and Killua's
Hunterpedia!
It's Gon
and Killua's
Hunterpedia!
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
Today, we introduce Chrollo.
Boss of the Phantom Troupe.
The Phantom Troupe's boss.
A Specialist.
He's a Specialist.
He can steal and use
others' powers,
He can steal other people's powers for himself,
using his Skill Hunter!
an appropriate ability
for a bandit.
But conditions have to be met.
East, huh...
Next time: Bid x And x Haste.
A bid in haste makes waste.
Hey!
That's no good...
﻿There he is.
That's your target.
The tycoon, Mr. Battera.
Objective?
That would be Greed Island, of course.
Why are you so interested in a game?
You've spent a considerable
amount on it by now.
It is an expression of love.
Isn't wanting to monopolize
that which you love natural?
What is this love you mention?
There are many rumors flying around.
Any comments?
I will get my hands on the clue Ging left!
Bid x And x Haste
What time is it?
Kurapika!
It's 2:00 PM.
I slept for half a day?
It's been two whole days, Kurapika...
Where's the boss?
What about the underground auction?
It ended up being canceled.
The rest of the merchandise
will be auctioned online.
The boss accepted that.
You're lying.
Eh?
She was looking forward to
taking part in the auction.
I don't see her accepting that so easily...
Squala was killed.
And Eliza was inconsolable...
The Scarlet Eyes we won were stolen.
But apparently,
the boss was severely shocked by Eliza's state.
That was when she said
she wanted to go home.
I see.
What about Gon and Killua?
They're both fine.
Around now...
He fell asleep.
They're doing what they need to do,
so you should get plenty of rest.
Our next item
is the legendary game,
Greed Island !
Let's take a look at the mysterious
power this game contains.
As you can see, there is a mysterious power
that protects the console from any damage,
as long as someone is playing inside.
This man is Jeitsari.
He is a player who's inside
the game at this moment.
In fact, he's the one who signed a contract
allowing us to auction it off.
So this copy wasn't brought here by Ging.
Jeitsari left behind the following agreement:
"If we cannot clear this game
before the date specified in the contract,
seven active players, including myself,
will present seven copies
of the game and console
to the Southern Piece Auction,
so our talented young Hunters
can clear the game and fulfill our dream."
Unfortunately, when we
obtained these copies,
two already displayed game over screens.
That means the players also died in real life.
This dangerous game requires
that you risk your own life!
Make sure you're prepared before you bid.
Let's start the bidding at 900 million Jenny!
I have 1 billion!
I have 1.5 billion!
#105 doubles it to 3 billion.
#71 doubles it again...
to 6 billion!
Hey! That's my brother!
So you indicate how much
you're bidding with your hand?
Yeah,
the auctioneer is able to
instantly discern the highest bid.
#16 doubles it again...
to 12 billion!
What's this?
#201 doubles it again,
to 24 billion!
You idiot!
#16 bids 25 billion!
Whew, that was close...
I'm guessing he wasn't able to
decipher that memory card.
#71 bids 25.5 billion...
How much money does he have?
#16 goes all the way up to 30.5 billion!
Damn it!
30.5 billion, huh?
No matter...
If we can clear this game.
Um, we're Hunters.
We're willing to help clear Greed Island.
Don't joke around. Go on home.
We're not joking! I'm a pro Hunter.
What nonsense.
Do you have a license?
Yes!
Uh, you don't.
It's at the pawn shop.
Oh.
Uh, it's not on me...
See... He's lying.
I'm not lying!
Hold on...
The fact that you're here means
you're certainly not ordinary.
However, I can't blindly
accept everything you say.
I am indeed looking to hire
Hunters in order to clear this game,
but I cannot hire you at this time.
Because there can only be so many players.
Crap...
Has our plan failed?
I'm thinking that we don't
need to buy the game.
We just want the data inside it.
And I bet some of the people
who win copies of Greed Island
will be looking for players, too.
There can only be so many players?
Each memory card only has the
capacity to store one player's data.
With multitaps, you can have a
maximum of eight players per console.
Oh, right.
That Greed Island save used up
all thirty blocks on that memory card.
Yeah.
How did you know that?!
We have a Greed Island save file.
Have you played the game before?
No, we only have a memory card.
Does that mean...
If that memory card is real,
you would need another item to remove the card
from the console.
Would that be...
The ring?
They know about the ring, too.
It appears that they are worthy of consideration.
I assume that you can use Nen.
Show me your Ren.
Sure!
Well?
It's hopeless.
Letting them play would be a waste of time.
They'd run around in circles until they died.
How can you be certain when we haven't tried?!
It'll be too late once you're in the game, kid.
Unless you die off immediately.
We don't need people who'll
drag out the inevitable.
As long as a player is alive inside the game,
you can't reset or remove the memory card.
In other words, you can't send in new players.
I've hired around one hundred
pro and amateur Hunters to play this game,
and over half of them have given up.
Given up?
They've given up on returning to the real world,
choosing to live inside the game.
That is why I must be careful
when selecting players.
We need people
who are strong enough to obtain items
for returning to the real world.
And you're saying we aren't strong enough?
How can he know that?
Because he's a pro Hunter who
has played Greed Island before.
Speaking from my own experience,
the items for returning to the real
world are relatively easy to obtain.
But with your Nen, it's hopeless.
In fact, it'd be game over in no time.
Once the screening is done,
I'm returning to the game.
Screening?
You're screening players?
Yes, the screening will be
on the auction's final day.
If you're interested in participating,
you'll need to work on your Nen.
We were going to do that anyway!
Let's go, Killua!
Before you go, kid...
How did you come by a memory card?
I'm not telling you!
Damn it... I'm mad now.
We absolutely must pass their screening!
Screening...
What's the plan?
You even need to ask?
We're bandits.
We steal.
Let's return to the base and play.
A memory card is already inserted,
so only one more can play.
We can use a multitap.
Four more can play now.
Nice...
So who goes first?
I'll go first.
Whoa...
He really did disappear.
I was kind of skeptical...
What was that?
It's a game. Wanna play?
I'll pass.
If I feel like it.
Okay.
Catch you later, then.
He disappeared, too.
What kind of game is this?
A game where you can actually die.
It's listed in the auction catalog.
I'm so mad!
I can't believe how he spouted off!
Damn it!
Still, he's right.
What do you mean?
Chill out a little.
We should start thinking about
taking this to the next level.
Next level?
Hatsu.
You know, our special abilities.
Kurapika started learning Nen when we did.
But he was able to fight the Troupe
because of his special abilities.
Yeah, Kurapika obtained powers that
make him basically invincible against the Troupe
by placing his life on the line.
We can't follow his example.
We need abilities without
too much or too little risk,
which still fit our specialties.
Something practical and effective...
That's what we have to come up with.
Well, I knew this would happen.
Let's take this one step at a time.
First, what kind of abilities do you want?
What kind of abilities do I want?
Hey!
You must have at least a vague idea.
Uh, a really strong power!
That's too vague!
Start by thinking within your own category.
You're an Enhancer,
so think of a power that strengthens something.
Then we ask,
what part of you do you
want to strengthen, and how?
That hurt!
What about you, then?
I already know what I want.
That's why I'm helping you.
Really? What do you want?
It's a secret.
Huh?
Gon, I'm going to go start
practicing my special ability.
You keep thinking about it.
Though it's possible that I'm the only
one who'll pass the screening.
He'll just get distracted
unless I give him a scare.
Visualize my aura fusing with electricity.
Then I visualize
the electricity being released,
while refining my Nen!
But with your Nen,
it'd be game over in no time.
Damn it!
I'll make him eat those words!
You sound determined, Gon.
Kurapika!
Are you better?
Yeah, my fever broke.
I'm fine now.
He doesn't look fine.
But if Kurapika finds out
that the spiders are still in Yorknew City...
Is there any way to stop him?
So how did the auction go?
I believe you were after an expensive game?
Oh, yeah...
Tea
I see.
So they're screening players...
Say, what kind of training did you do?
Once I decided to conjure chains,
I did a lot of image training...
I closed my eyes, while feeling real chains.
I drew hundreds, thousands of sketches.
I looked at chains, licked chains...
I also smelled and listened to chains.
My master told me to do nothing
but handle chains all the time.
After a while, he took them away.
That was when I began to hallucinate chains...
Eventually, those hallucinations
began to feel heavy and cold,
and I could hear them grating.
Once I reached that point,
I was able to conjure chains.
Other than that, I did the same training as you.
Ten and Ren.
I know, Kurapika...
You can be my master!
You can point out what I'm doing right.
This way, I can keep Kurapika occupied
while the auction takes place.
I'm sorry, but I cannot.
Huh?
My boss will be leaving tomorrow.
I am obligated to accompany her.
You're leaving Yorknew City?
Yeah.
I'm still concerned about the spiders...
But it's been two days,
so they're probably already gone.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Who taught you Nen?
You should probably
ask them rather than me.
Special abilities?
That sounds like you boys.
I can tell you right now
that Enhancers don't need special abilities.
Why not?
Because Enhancers are the
most balanced between offense and defense.
If you master Ten and Ren,
those will be strong enough to be
considered special abilities.
But I don't have time.
I have to pass a screening in four days...
Gon-kun,
if I were a judge,
I would be disappointed to see
an improvised special ability.
Listen carefully, Gon-kun.
You must not emulate that Kurapika person.
I'm sure you don't need me to tell you why.
No...
You needn't emulate anyone else
when you're already so strong.
You think so?
Of course.
Reflect on the things you've been able to do.
That should help you find the answer you seek.
A-A hint...
Please give me a hint!
You sound pretty flustered...
Haste makes waste.
In the end, hard work always pays off.
I would agree if it weren't for this deadline...
All right, here's a big hint, then.
You only showed that Tsezgerra
person your normal Ren, right?
Yeah.
Next time, show him everything simultaneously.
Everything?
Yes, listen carefully.
Show him everything you've
learned simultaneously.
Everything I've learned simultaneously.
Ten...
Shroud myself in aura.
Zetsu...
Suppress my aura.
Ren...
Bring forth an incredible amount of aura.
And Hatsu...
Wait.
Ren requires me to bring forth aura,
while Zetsu requires suppressing it.
If I do them both at once...
Oh?
His brain fried again?
Hang in there, Gon.
If you take too long,
I'll leave you behind!
It's impossible...
How do I bring forth and suppress
something at the same time?
Reflect on the things you've been able to do.
After Wing-san helped unleash my Nen,
I went into battle knowing only Ten,
and got myself seriously hurt.
But in the process, I mastered Zetsu.
Then I learned Gyo to see through
Hisoka's special ability.
Gyo?
Right! I have Gyo!
Gyo...
Concentrate aura in your eyes
to see hidden aura.
Concentrate?
Right, I concentrated on my eyes,
so I never noticed what else was happening.
There's a little aura being released.
If I can suppress it,
I'll be doing everything at once!
Yes! I did it!
No good...
The second I relaxed, it fell apart.
But it works!
If I can concentrate the aura
from my Ren in one place,
that'll be a lot of power.
I want to test that power!
Gon-kun, haste makes waste.
Osu!
He finally figured something out.
You won't beat me, Gon!
The two boys are about to
undergo a new awakening.
G.I. Tutorial
Coming up, it's the Greed Island Tutorial!
Today is the first episode
of Greed Island Tutorial!
What does "tutorial" mean?
It's like an instruction manual.
Each week, we'll explain how the game works.
Click.
Continue!
Next time: End x And x Beginning.
Book!
Achoo!
Game!
Boom!
What's your name?
Gon!
Good job.
﻿You're really sure? You won't tell them?
Yes.
Right now, they should be
spending every second training.
Tell them we'll meet again.
Sure.
So long.
Goodbye.
Oh, one second...
Look after Kurapika.
He acts calm, but he can be rash.
He's smart, but doesn't
always think things through.
It looks like he's opened up to you,
so could you act as a brake?
Yes.
You're very soothing.
You have the most pleasant
heartbeat I've heard in this city.
It's soft, expansive, and very warm.
You would make an excellent
doctor or teacher.
You're well suited to such careers.
I recommend a career change.
Well, I'll think about it.
I need to get serious about this...
End x And x Beginning
#16 has won Greed Island for 27.8 billion!
Thank you very much!
That bastard's serious
about buying every copy.
And he's aware of my budget.
Only one copy left.
Damn...
I'm going to win this auction!
What? He left?
We'll see him again.
He said to keep training hard.
What? He didn't have to worry about that...
Weren't you happy that Kurapika
was leaving Yorknew City?
Sure, but he left without telling us.
Here.
It's from Zepile.
He said that you'll see him again.
What?
Zepile-san's gone, too?
Yeah, and he recovered your
hundred million, as promised.
He really did...
Now you can buy back
your Hunter License.
Yeah...
Zepile-san really is special.
Man, that Hunter License is a real gem.
The pawn shop forked over a
hundred million on the spot.
In a proper auction, you could
probably add two zeros...
I know!
I should become a pro Hunter
so I can sell the license...
I could live off the interest alone.
And forget about debt!
Okay, then let's get crackin'!
And start prepping for the Hunter Exam!
#16 wins Greed Island for 60.2 billion.
Thank you very much.
60.2 billion..
That's insane.
And he won all seven copies.
But it cost him half of his wealth.
Recently, an unknown party
stole a copy of Greed Island
won at auction for 30.5 billion by Mr. Battera.
But, not to be discouraged, yesterday he
won another copy for 27.8 billion,
and another today for 60.2 billion.
He must have some reason
to go so far for this game.
I've heard that upon clearing the game,
you receive a treasure map.
Or a giant dragon appears
to grant your wish.
All kinds of rumors are flying around.
Thank you!
I'm going home.
Mr. Battera was able to acquire
all the copies of Greed Island.
He's also seeking players,
but today's the deadline!
There's already an amazing
line outside the venue.
I apologize for keeping everyone waiting.
We will now begin selecting the players.
As everyone already knows,
you must be able to use Nen for this game.
The test will proceed as follows.
First, we need each applicant
to demonstrate their Nen.
We will then make our decision.
The judge will be the
pro Hunter, Mr. Tsezgerra!
The Money Hunter Tsezgerra!
If he's involved...
This game must pay big dividends.
Let us begin the test.
One at a time, come up
and show me your Ren.
A shutter and curtain will block
any view of the stage,
so other applicants cannot
see what's happening.
The moment we've chosen thirty-two
players, the test will end.
Please step this way to take the test.
That's our only explanation?
Would the first applicant
please step in.
They only gave us a minimal explanation
and left everything unknown.
But the others are already moving
like it's the natural response.
They must know.
Those guys aren't going to answer any questions.
Our task is simple.
Deduce all we can from the information
provided, and then do our best.
I'm certain they're judging
us on the entire process.
Approximately two hundred are in the hall.
About a hundred have already lined up.
At least fifty are watching from the sidelines.
And twenty haven't moved an inch.
Which group chose correctly?
Next, please.
Next.
Something's wrong...
Ten people have gone in,
but no one's come out!
Does that mean they all passed?
This is bad.
Should we get in line?
Those guys are hopeless...
They don't stand a chance.
Huh?
I'm talking about the ones still in
line and those waiting nearby.
Especially the ones
standing next to the line.
They're probably waiting
for someone to return,
so they can ask what's inside.
If you did some research
and used your head,
you'd see there's no rush.
In other words, you can't
send in new players.
That is why I must be careful
when selecting players.
I get it!
This time, they aren't
choosing thirty-two players!
Exactly.
It's been over ten years,
and no one's cleared the game.
And new players can't begin
if old ones are still alive.
Meaning that they have
to save a few spots
in case any extraordinary
players appear.
I'd guess they'll choose
around twenty this round...
Personally, I'd say that those in line
or standing nearby have no shot.
Anyone worthwhile either
got in line at once,
or figured out the trick and stayed in
their seats to focus, like we did.
Wouldn't you agree, kid?
Gon?
You realized what was going on?
Well, it was just a hunch.
I thought it was only natural that the hosts
would want to test everyone here.
That's true.
You win, kid.
Yeah, I'm impressed.
Not many people can stick to their ideals.
The steeper and more dangerous the path,
the greater the need for both wit
and ignorance to move forward.
Next, please.
My name is Puhat.
Nice to meet you.
People who act smart usually fail.
He can hear you.
But he's right.
I was too focused on logically
deducing the best method.
I'm heading over.
Yep, good luck.
If I want to advance,
I'll have to take risks.
Because I've chosen a dangerous path!
Listen to me... Never take risks.
Act only when success is guaranteed.
Otherwise, wait.
Waiting is our most crucial job.
If victory isn't assured, revealing your
strength is the most foolish move to make.
That's how my old man operates.
But I'm no longer an assassin.
I'm a Hunter!
Let me see your Ren.
Can I show you my Hatsu instead?
That's fine.
You're free to show me anything
that demonstrates your power.
Prove that the Ren I saw previously
didn't represent your true power.
Then, I'll get started.
He changed his aura into electricity!
In theory, it's certainly possible...
But it's unbelievable
that he learned this from
scratch in four days!
Well? Need to see more?
No, that's enough.
You pass.
Yes!
However, this technique could not
have fully developed overnight.
You'd require years of
torturous training,
exposing your body to strong electricity.
Who are you?
Strong electricity?
From birth, I've been
exposed to electricity.
Family reasons.
Seven people...
That guy was right.
The people who passed are those
who moved immediately
or waited in their seats.
Well, I wonder if Gon will be okay.
Gon.
Killua!
Good, you got chosen.
Of course.
Was that boom your doing?
Uh-huh.
Honestly...
Those kids are scary.
Well, allow me to congratulate you.
The twenty-one people
here have earned the
right to play Greed Island.
Upon clearing the game,
you will receive 50 billion Jenny.
The details are in the contract,
so read and sign it before
you depart at 5 PM.
Cheers!
You've made it past the first stage.
Could you look at this for us?
What is it?
A contract?
Looks like it can be summarized in three points.
First, you can't file any claims
if you're injured or die.
Second, any items that you bring out
of the game belong to Mr. Battera.
Third, if you clear the game,
you will receive a
50-billion Jenny reward.
I don't see any problems.
Yep!
So once you sign it, you're good to go.
That second point seems important.
"Anything that you
bring out of the game."
That's why he's paying the big bucks.
Anything? Like what?
I'm willing to hand it over.
I'm not looking for items.
I just want to get closer to Ging!
See ya.
Good luck on your exam, Leorio.
Yeah, you guys be careful.
Next time we see you,
you'll be a doctor.
Wouldn't that mean we won't see
each other for at least four years?
We plan to clear the
game much more quickly.
I don't intend to fall behind.
Now, then...
Before we begin, let me
explain a few things.
The individual game copies
are not independent.
It doesn't matter which
console you start from.
You will all arrive at the same place.
Consider it a virtual area accessible
from any spot on this planet.
Fizz...
I will now hand out memory cards.
You will head immediately into the game.
But first, we must decide the order.
Order?
Only one may enter the game area at a time.
We will decide the order now,
to forestall bickering inside the game.
Then let's use rock-paper-scissors.
Yes! I'm first!
Oh?
You're the boy who had a save file.
Damn, I'm 17th!
Do you want to use it?
Don't worry.
Your initial destination is
always the same, regardless of your save.
Ging...
This game is a message from Ging to me.
I'm going to trust him!
I'll use my own card.
Then put the ring on,
and start the game.
Gon.
Wait in the starting
area until I get there.
Once you see a "Now Playing" message,
the next person can begin.
Welcome to Greed Island.
You must be Mr. Gon Freecss.
I will now explain how the game works.
Would you care to listen?
Sure.
In this game, two magic spells are
available to anyone wearing a ring:
Book and Gain.
Place the hand with the ring in
front of you, and say, "Book."
Book.
In this game, your task is
to collect certain cards.
That book is for storing the
cards you've collected.
Please look at the first page.
Each slot is labeled with a number.
You can only place cards of the
same number in these slots.
These are your "restricted slots."
Please flip ahead a few pages.
Wait, there aren't any numbers!
Yes, you may place any
card inside these slots.
These are your "free slots."
There are 100 restricted slots,
numbered 0 to 99.
Then, you have another 45 free slots.
To clear this game, you must
fill the 100 restricted slots.
I just need to collect a hundred cards?
Yes.
Specifically, you must
transform one hundred items
into cards and put them in your book.
Transform them?
For example, if you obtain a sword,
it will become a card
the moment you get it.
If you wish to use a card as the item,
you must use the spell "Gain."
Gain...
However, once you've used Gain to return
a card to item form, you can never
transform it into a card again.
If you want to make it a card again,
you must reacquire the item.
Do you understand everything so far?
Yeah, basically...
There are two other cases in which
you cannot transform
an item into a card.
The first is when you reach the item's
maximum card transformation limit.
Card transformation limit?
Yes, every item in this game has
a card transformation limit.
For example, if an item has a
transformation limit of three,
and three players have already
transformed the item into a card,
the fourth to find it will be
unable to change it into a card.
In the second case...
Huh?
If you don't place the card into
your book within one minute,
it will automatically revert to an item.
In this case, as well,
you can never transform
that item into a card again.
Do you understand?
Yeah, kinda...
Finally, the most important note...
I can't remember all of this...
If a player dies,
their book and ring are destroyed
and the book's contents are lost.
Does it matter anymore if you're dead?
That concludes my explanation.
You'll need to learn everything else
about the game by playing it.
Uh-huh, got it.
Thanks.
I wish you the best of luck.
Please take those stairs.
Loading save data.
I have a message from Ging Freecss.
From Ging?
I'm glad to see you've made it, Gon.
My friends and I made this game.
Enjoy yourself.
But if you expected a clue to my
location, you're out of luck.
I just wanted to show
off this game to you.
It doesn't matter what brought you here.
Because you won't be able to leave
until you obtain a specific item.
So play away.
Gon has finally stepped foot inside
the legendary game Greed Island.
A new adventure is about to begin.
G.I. Tutorial
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!
The descriptions on cards are written
in the Hunter language,
but we'll translate them
into Japanese for your convenience.
Rock
A normal rock found
on the ground.
Does decent damage
when thrown.
Gain!
G.I. Tutorial
Continue!
Next time: Invitation x and x Friend.
Thanks, Gon.
Thanks, Killua.
Thanks, Gon!
Thanks, Killua!
You're embarrassing me!
﻿A field of green.
Stretching as far as I can see...
I'm being watched.
Someone's out there...
Invitation x And x Friend
Anyway, I have to wait for Killua.
Yo, sorry to make you wait.
Do you feel something
constantly watching us?
Yeah, eyes this persistent
can only be a human's.
So everyone's noticed.
Well, they can't be too good
if we can sense them from here.
Just ignore it.
We're being watched.
Killua!
Sorry.
I don't see any nearby towns.
Yeah, but everyone headed
in the same directions.
They either went this way or that way?
Huh? How did you know?
Because that's where we're
being watched from.
But we still don't know
why they're watching us.
True.
Well, let's go.
Regardless of who's watching, we should
start by gathering information.
So, how did it go?
Hmm?
Your save data.
Book.
How many cards were inside?
There weren't any cards inside.
Huh? For real?
But there was a message from Ging.
What did he say?
To enjoy the game.
Enjoy the game?
But this doesn't really feel like a game.
Book.
What do you think about the rules?
I still don't know enough yet.
What was that?
Was it Nen?
This must be your first
time playing this game.
I wonder if you're right.
Since you're carrying a book,
you must be a player.
Well, sure.
You can't fool me.
I know you're new to this game.
Steal
Reveal all free slots of
one target player. (Can
only be used on a player
who's been encountered
within the game.)
[LR][NORM]
I can use the Steal card.
Casting Steal.
Select target player.
What is he doing?!
Zefespa
Grecoloas
Killua
Gon
Killua-kun and Gon-kun, huh?
How do you know our names?
How indeed?
You have zero chance if you don't
know about the spell cards.
View Killua's free slots?
Yes      No
No cards in Killua's free slots.
Steal card was consumed.
And that confirms it.
They're total newbies who just arrived.
And they're kids.
Adhesion
Complete data of one target
player's restricted slots will
be available at all times.
(Effect lasts until player
leaves the game.)
[SR][ATK]
I don't wanna waste this spell on them.
Trace
Current location of one
target player will be
available at all times.
(Effect lasts until player
leaves the game.)
[SR][ATK]
Trace should be good enough.
Trace on!
Attack, Killua!
You can't run from spells in this game!
Killua, are you okay?
My attack worked!
What did you just do to me?
This kid's dangerous!
Return
Warp to a city
of your choice.
(Must be a city
you have visited.)
[LR][NORM]
Return on!
Take me to Masadora!
Shizuku, Kortopi...
Do you have a moment?
Play the game?
Yes, would you like to join me?
Once we get home,
there's nothing for us to do.
You really want to clear this game?
Actually, clearing it isn't my goal.
Then this relates to Troupe business?
More or less.
Understood.
Sure.
Killua, how are you holding up?
Hmm? I don't feel any different.
But I'm still worried.
He definitely did something to you.
No point in worrying about it now.
Hey, was he using Nen
when he said, "Trace on"?
No, it's probably some magic
that only works in the game.
Magic? What kind?
Beats me.
Well, we'll find out eventually.
Yeah.
Look, there's a town!
Welcome to Antokiba, City of Prizes
Are those the prizes?
Wow, all these are prizes?
Looks that way.
Oh, Killua...
Look.
"Antokiba Monthly Tournaments Schedule."
There's a rock-paper-scissors
tournament this month.
September: Rock-Paper-Scissors
Prize: Sword of Truth
The prize is a Sword of Truth.
Is that an important item?
Probably.
Look over there.
And over there.
Should we participate?
Of course.
Then let's try to win all kinds of prizes.
We should also gather information.
Welcome!
If you can finish this within thirty
minutes, you don't need to pay!
In addition, you'll also receive
a Galgaida as your prize.
Galgaida
One of the island's
three greatest delicacies.
Delicious, despite its
appearance. The roe is
said to extend your life.
Good boiled or grilled.
Okay, begin!
Hey, chef.
Do you know how to use magic?
What's that?
Who's the most knowledgeable
person in this city?
Knowledgeable? What's that?
This guy doesn't know anything.
He's probably just an in-game character.
Oh, no! You did it!
Here is your prize, Galgaida.
"1217.
F-185."
What does that mean?
Is this your first time seeing a card?
Galgaida
One of the island's
three greatest delicacies.
Delicious, despite its
appearance. The roe is
said to extend your life.
Good boiled or grilled.
The left number is the item's card number,
and the sequence on the right
ranks how difficult it is to obtain.
There are ten ranks, from SS to H.
F would be the third easiest.
The number next to the rank is the item's
maximum transformation limit.
Oh, which means this item card...
Is nothing but junk.
I've never seen him around.
That's brutal.
He's one of the players who entered with us.
Hey, what happened?
His body suddenly exploded.
From the inside.
We've only been inside the
game for a few hours,
and someone's already dead.
And this corpse has a very real presence.
Hard to believe it's a game.
We're risking our lives here.
He disappeared?
He probably went back to the real world.
Game over.
Hey, Killua.
Was the magic used on you earlier...
I don't know.
Don't worry.
There's no such spell in this game.
Spell?
As you just said, it's something like magic.
He died from another player's Nen.
Nen ?
Does that mean the players are
trying to kill each other?
Why?
Player hunting.
Player hunting?
I can explain later.
Anyway, are you interested in teaming up?
We know of a sure way to clear this game.
Huh?
If you're interested, follow me.
My allies are waiting ahead.
What do we do?
Sounds suspicious.
And we're already off to a bad start.
As I recall,
on your way here, another player
used an attack spell on you.
Have you been watching us?
Yeah.
And I wasn't the only one.
Lots of people keep an eye
on the starting point.
If you come, I'll explain why.
I can also tell you about the
spell that was cast on you.
You're being very nice.
There must be a catch.
We have no choice.
This game is difficult,
unpleasant, and frightening.
Once you realize that,
you'll be more willing to accept our offer.
Well, it's your first time playing,
so you could use the information...
What makes you think it's our first time?
We could be returning players.
Book.
This proves that you're beginners.
An experienced player would react
by summoning his own binder.
Because you need spell cards
to defend yourself.
Then the spell cast on Killua...
Could only be stopped by another card.
Even when you aren't carrying any cards,
you should still summon it.
It's an important bluff.
Book.
Hey, how do we obtain spell cards?
The easiest method would be to
go to Masadora, City of Magic.
Masadora?
Return
Warp to a city
of your choice.
(Must be a city
you have visited.)
[LR][NORM]
Return on!
Take me to Masadora!
Killua, we should go with him.
I'm worried about the spell on you.
Okay?
Sure...
Is this everyone?
Yeah.
Everyone else turned me down.
Let's get started, then.
Another player was just killed.
He arrived with the rest of you.
His stomach exploded.
It was the Bomber.
The Bomber?
The victims aren't killed by spells.
No spell in this game is capable
of injuring people.
Which means that you won't be harmed or killed
by any spell that's been cast on you.
There are forty different spells.
The one cast on you was an inspection spell.
Either Trace or Adhesion.
Trace
Current location of one
target player will be
available at all times.
(Effect lasts until player
leaves the game.)
[SR][ATK]
In short,
once the enemy uses these on you,
Adhesion
Complete data of one target
player's restricted slots will
be available at all times.
(Effect lasts until player
leaves the game.)
[SR][ATK]
he will then know everything about you.
I get it.
That's why...
Some players wait near the starting point
in order to cast these spells on new players.
As soon as a player obtains a valuable card,
they'll show up and steal it.
In some cases, they kill their target.
Like the guy who just died?
I won't be that easy to kill.
No, he was killed by something else.
There is a violent faction hunting players.
This was done by one of them...
The Bomber.
Bomber...
In this game, there are three
ways to acquire item cards.
Do you know what they are?
Find them yourself.
Trade with other players.
Steal them from other players.
Yes, those are the three ways.
However,
the number of players stealing
from others has recently increased.
That's due to the card's difficulty to obtain
and the card transformation limit system.
Players who can't obtain cards themselves
choose to take them from others.
If those players resist, they're killed.
When they die, their ring disappears,
and their cards are lost.
However, it increases the transformation
limit of that type of card.
If you kill a player, you can't take his cards.
That rule was meant to keep
players from killing one another.
But now, it's backfiring.
It's been over ten years since the game's release.
If no one can find a way to beat it,
the killing will only continue.
That's why we're trying to end this mess.
We're recruiting allies to clear this game.
We need your help.
How do you plan to obtain cards?
1) Find them yourself.
2) Trade for them.
3) Steal them.
Which method will you use?
3...
I assume you mean to use all three methods,
but 3 will be the primary method.
What, so you'll still use force?
No!
We won't use violence to reach our goal.
Spells.
You'll use spells.
Am I right?
Correct.
There are certain spells for taking cards,
and there are cards that
defend against those spells.
We'll focus on monopolizing these cards.
We're going to use the very
card transformation limit
that's frustrated the players.
This is the only way to clear the game.
I have met many players, and they
all reached the same conclusion.
Even if you search for cards,
they'll be taken from you eventually.
Because this game is based on
players taking cards from each other.
We will ensure that we can take
cards from other players,
while mitigating our risk of losing cards.
You're leaving out something important.
Upon clearing the game,
how will you split the reward?
You were hired by Mr. Battera, right?
So you knew who we were when you invited us.
Yeah.
Mr. Battera also hired us to play this game.
That means the reward will be 50 billion.
We'll split it among everyone who helps.
Currently, we have fifty-three players.
It'll take two months to collect
the remaining spell cards,
and one month to get the cards we need.
We can finish in three months.
Of course, if you join us,
we'll remove any spells cast on you.
I'm in.
I don't like the idea of splitting the 50 billion.
But I like the three month schedule
for clearing the game.
What about you?
I have a question.
If I obtain an SS rank card on
my own, what's my cut?
Naturally, you'd receive 500 million
for a card of that rank.
Okay, I'm in.
What about you two?
Killua, sorry.
Hmm? What?
I'm out.
I'm playing this game on my own.
You heard the leader.
I have to pass.
Hey, Gon! Wait up...
What about you?
We'll need you to first exit the game,
so the spells placed on you can be removed.
Once you're back in the game,
wait by the starting point.
We'll come get you.
If you have any cards in your free slots,
give them to me now.
Why?
When you leave the game,
the cards in your free slots disappear.
I believe your data automatically
saves when cards are
put in or removed from restricted slots.
Yes, but your data disappears
if you don't return within ten days.
If you don't return before then,
we'll assume that you gave up.
Got it?
Don't worry, we're being joined by an ally.
We don't know if anyone's watching.
Let's get started.
Leave
Send one
target player
off the island.
[SR][NORM]
I'll be using the Leave card.
Hey, Gon...
Will you explain what that was about?
Sorry, Killua.
I couldn't take it anymore.
I still don't get why you're apologizing.
But this means you'll be stuck
with that spell for a while.
Oh, that's why.
It's not a big deal.
But you're playing this game
to help me find my dad...
You're wrong.
I'm playing this game because...
Anyway, why were you so mad?
Because they had nothing
but bad things to say about
the game Ging made, like how
it's based on killing and stealing.
I want to do what Ging said,
and enjoy the game.
When I first started,
I knew it wouldn't be easy.
That was because I thought all the
players enjoyed playing the game.
People have died.
But it's the player mentality,
not the game, that scares me.
They're willing to hurt others to get cards.
Really?
I think it makes sense.
Killua, you really mean that?
That's why this game is meant for Hunters.
But...
Killing is wrong.
I agree with you on that part.
But what if two players have a fair
fight with predetermined rules,
and the winner gets to take a card?
Th-That's acceptable.
See?
When that guy cast a spell on me
and when those guys carry out their plan,
they're just following the game's rules.
Yeah.
Though it does still feel lame.
Well, forget about them.
Let's enjoy this game.
Killua...
Hmm?
Thanks.
I'm glad you came with me.
No...
I'm glad I got to know you!
Cut it out, stupid.
You're embarrassing me.
Why? I really mean it.
You've got it backwards.
Gon, I should thank you.
I'm the one who's glad
that I got to know you...
I understand.
So that's why.
Such a beautiful thing, the friendship
and innocence of two young boys.
I feel like messing with them.
Gon and Killua have
reaffirmed their friendship.
But who is the girl watching them?
G.I. Tutorial
Coming up, it's the Greed Island Tutorial!
Today, we introduce the card Return.
Return
Warp to a city
of your choice.
(Must be a city
you have visited.)
[LR][NORM]
This travel card lets you instantly warp
to a city you've visited before.
Return on!
Mito-san's place.
It only works for places inside the game.
Huh?
Continue!
Next time: Reality x And x Raw.
If you polish a raw diamond, you can make it shine!
Hey, a shooting star!
Shiny.
﻿Championship Finals, round 7!
Ready...
Go!
First comes rock...
Rock... Paper...
Scissors!
Killua wins!
Yes!
Congratulations.
Here is your prize, the Sword of Truth.
Look, Gon...
Sword of Truth
Sword that cuts through
anything false. Has been
used in trials to determine
criminals. Breaks if used
to cut something true,
but will regenerate if left
in scabbard for a day.
This is card #83.
It goes in a restricted slot.
Okay, that's one down.
Score!
Reality x And x Raw
The problem
is how we protect the card.
We don't have any defensive spell cards.
Wait, kids!
H-Hand over the Sword of Truth!
Do as I say,
and I won't be rough with you.
No way, stupid.
W-Wait!
Book!
Book!
Hmph, you're bluffing.
I know that you just started this game.
You have no defensive spells,
and all you would have in your restricted slots
is the Sword of Truth.
This is Thief!
Thief
Steal one random card
from a restricted slot
of one target player.
[SR][ATK]
This spell card lets you steal
one random card from
another player's restricted slots!
Take this...
Thief on!
Attack Killua!
Haven't you been training at all,
Mister?
Next time, I won't return your card.
You must be an amateur.
I'm impressed you got into a game for Hunters.
But that was very educational.
An attack spell won't kick in
until you finish the chant.
Th-That only works against weak players!
Precisely.
If you want a card,
you take it from someone.
Only fools would participate in tournaments.
Understand, boys?
I'm so pissed!
Just forget it.
Those guys were obviously pros.
At least we didn't waste too much effort.
Damn it!
Then I'm gonna start getting spell cards!
That means our next destination
will be Masadora, City of Magic.
No objections!
That's our base.
We'll begin assigning roles.
You will collect spell cards for us.
You've probably heard that there
are forty different spell cards.
We need you to obtain
one of those cards, Prison.
Prison
All slotted cards on target
page are immune to theft
or destruction via spell
card until removed from
their slot. (Can only
target pages 1 - 11.
Free slot pages
cannot be targeted.)
[DEF][CONT]
This is one of the strongest defensive spells.
We could certainly use another one of these.
In order to protect Breath of Archangel.
Breath of Archangel?
A super-rare SS card that no one's
ever been able to obtain.
How can you be certain no
one's gotten one before?
List
Reveal number of card
holders and number of
cards for a target item.
[LR][NORM]
There's a spell card called List.
When you cast it,
you can learn the maximum
transformation limit of any card
as well as the number of current card holders.
I see.
The card is very difficult to obtain
because you must have all forty spell
cards before you can trade for one.
But spell cards are extremely
useful in this game,
so players tend to use them up.
However, we've been able
to collect all forty spell cards.
We would prefer to trade them in for
a Breath of Archangel at once...
But then you'd have no cards to protect it.
That's why you need a copy of Prison.
Exactly.
At any rate, to carry out this plan,
we'll need you all to memorize
the forty different spell cards.
Those four Galgaida cards
netted us 120,000 Jenny.
They were pretty valuable.
We don't need to worry about money now.
Let's buy some food and water,
so we can start for Masadora!
First, we'll need a map.
Map of Island
A blank map that
automatically fills in
locations as the owner
visits and gathers
information about them.
Map of Island
A detailed map
showing cities
and important
locations, as well
as useful information
such as hot spots!
The one with information costs 650,000,
while the blank one is 20,000.
Which one should we get?
The 20,000 one.
It'll be more fun to fill it in ourselves.
You're so positive, it's painful.
Gain.
This doesn't tell us anything.
Then let's ask.
Head north for eighty kilometers.
After you pass the mountain,
you'll reach a lake.
If you follow the lake north,
you should reach Masadora.
If we hurry, we can go
eighty kilometers in a day.
Yep.
Assuming you survive.
The mountain is crawling with bandits.
And once you pass the mountain,
you'll encounter hordes of monsters.
Bandits?
Monsters?
Now it sounds more like an RPG!
I wanna see these monsters!
Let's hurry up!
All right!
Off we go!
Please wait!
I beg you!
What?
Please let me join you!
Oh, sorry.
Can't.
Wh-Why not?
You'd be a nuisance.
Little brat...
You dare call me a nuisance?
If I chose to, I could mop the floor with
you, with one hand behind my back.
That does it.
I was just going to tease these boys a little,
but now I'm going to ruin their lives.
Hey, hold it right there!
Please!
I'll try really hard not to get in your way!
Okay, I have most of the information we need.
Then, can you tell us what you found?
All right. I'll start with number one.
I tried a hundred different people in this city,
and they all gave the same response
when faced with an unusual question.
This is typical behavior
for in-game characters.
Number two.
Book.
Rock
A normal rock found
on the ground.
Does decent damage
when thrown.
This card is real.
This one is a copy Kortopi made.
Gain.
Kortopi's card didn't transform.
I believe that means the game's program
didn't recognize Kortopi's card.
Number three.
Shizuku's vacuum works in this world,
but it won't work on any items
with special abilities.
I think that's because the game was programmed
so Nen couldn't be used to collect cards.
So?
However, the above three points
indicate another possibility.
This game isn't taking place
in a virtual world.
It's based somewhere in the real world.
What do you mean?
If the players actually entered the game,
their spirits would detach from
their bodies and enter the console,
leaving the bodies behind.
Sending them physically into the
game would be unnecessary.
And separating spirit from
body should require more
than standing before a console and using Hatsu.
It's more logical that the players
are actually warped elsewhere.
Thus,
Greed Island isn't a real game.
It's a trap that sends players who
use Hatsu here, to this island.
That makes sense.
But what does it mean?
Do you remember the reward
for clearing this game?
Let's see...
What was it?
You can select three item cards
from your restricted slots,
to take back to the real world.
Right.
That means these items can
be used outside the island.
If this game takes place in the real world,
it should be possible to remove
the treasure without clearing the game.
I understand.
Book.
At the moment, we only
know about a few items.
It would be ideal to learn all of the cards.
So our first objective is
the spell card God Eye.
God Eye
Grants the user the effects
of Analysis and List on
cards 001-099 at any time.
(Effect lasts until player
leaves the game.)
[LR][CONT]
Now we just need to find Phinks and Feitan.
Another cheap map?
But he was carrying a lot of spell cards.
Well, let's split up for now.
In one week, we'll meet in Masadora.
It's a contest to see who
can kill more players.
Okay, be sure to take their cards first.
Hey, what should we do about her?
Just ignore her.
Once the bandits show up,
we'll have a chance to ditch her.
Isn't that kind of mean?
What are you talking about?
Tsezgerra let her pass,
so she must have strong Nen.
She should be able to escape if it gets hairy.
I didn't think she'd keep up this long.
They have considerable physical strength.
For a couple of kids, anyway.
Let's take them.
Yeah.
Please help us!
We beg you!
Huh?
A disease is going around the island.
It starts with a mild fever,
grows to a high fever, and
eventually leads to death.
All we can do is use medicine
to keep the fever in check.
But the medicine will only work for a week.
It's also incredibly expensive,
and we've run out of money...
We've all fallen ill,
so we're unable to do any bandit work.
Is it contagious?
That's just a scenario.
My son only has two or three days to live!
Could you spare us any money?
This is an in-game event, right?
Yeah, if we give them money,
they should provide us with
items or information.
Uh, how much do you need?
80,000 Jenny.
That's all we have left.
So they know everything about us.
Um,
I have enough to cover 80,000 Jenny.
Ah, could you shut up for a moment?
I'm gonna kill that brat.
Got it.
We can give you 80,000 Jenny.
Really?
Thank you so much!
You've saved my son's life!
I'm c-cold.
So cold...
Oh, no!
If his body gets any colder,
he'll die before we can
get him the medicine!
If only we had some children's clothes!
Some children's clothes!
Um, I can give him my clothes.
That'd really be okay?
You're like angels!
Words are not enough...
...to express our gratitude!
Nah, we don't need thanks.
How about some information or items?
We got nothing?
We lost our clothes,
and now we're totally broke.
Damn, they're mocking us!
What was that about?
But once we get past this mountain,
we'll find lots of monsters, right?
Yeah.
If we beat them and turn them into cards,
we can sell them for lots of cash.
We finally get to start fighting!
Time to see what you've got.
Ditto.
I wanna see what you accomplished
during your secret training.
This area is rocky...
Let's go!
Yeah!
There are tons of them!
Gon's punch did no damage?
So no amount of punching will take one down.
And there are so many.
In order to disable it with a single attack...
Bingo! The eye is its weakness.
Book.
Gon, aim for the eye!
Got it!
They're moving around too much,
but they're doing reasonably well.
Weaker than they looked.
The card reverted after we
left it alone for a minute.
We can do this.
The monsters come with weaknesses.
If we stay calm and think, we'll be fine.
Okay.
Let's head for Masadora, then.
Yeah!
Huh?
Gon!
I'm okay!
That didn't hurt.
This one's weak.
But it's fast!
Let's catch it.
Damn!
Watch the trajectory,
not its current location.
With observation, you can learn an
opponent's pattern of motion.
Your eyes are sharp, but you
aren't using them properly.
It got away from us.
Well, it won't take very
long to reach Masadora
if they're all this weak.
Don't be stupid!
What if you encounter a monster
that's both strong and fast?
Bubbles?
It's gone...
It's loud and generates a shock wave,
but it doesn't do any damage.
When you touch them,
the red ones don't pop.
The white bubbles pop
when they make contact with a human aura.
The red ones pop when they make
contact with anything else.
To catch that horse, you must
identify which bubble is which,
then switch between Zetsu and Ten.
That's still too difficult for them.
Still...
These boys are...
These boys are just
wasting their potential!
They're raw stones that'll shine like
diamonds with a little polishing!
But at this rate, they'll run into
stronger players or monsters,
and it'll be game over!
This one looks tougher.
That's it...
I've had enough!
Gyo!
Keep your eyes on it!
Use Gyo!
Don't you know how?
See that?
The armor's just a puppet,
so attacks won't work against it.
Here it is!
I got the card!
So you can use Gyo.
Why didn't you use it before?
Uh, well...
Yeah...
So you forgot.
Why are you just standing there?
Gyo!
What do you see?
The number 1.
Good.
Listen up.
If I lift my finger, you use Gyo.
And then you holler out what you see.
If you ever sense anything suspicious, use Gyo.
Got it?
Wait, why are you ordering us around?
The number 5!
Correct.
Drop and give me two hundred push-ups.
Huh?
It's your punishment!
Get to it!
What the hell? Why should I?
Got a problem?
You bet!
Who do you think you are?
Oh, I haven't introduced myself yet.
I'm the pro Hunter Biscuit Krueger.
I first learned Nen forty years ago.
I'm going to use my wealth of
knowledge and experience
to coach you boys.
You should be grateful.
Forty years ago?!
You're an old hag!
As it turns out, the young girl
following Gon and Killua
is a highly experienced pro Hunter.
G.I. Tutorial
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!
Today, we'll introduce the card God Eye.
God Eye
Grants the user the effects
of Analysis and List on
cards 001-099 at any time.
(Effect lasts until player
leaves the game.)
[LR][CONT]
That's the card Shalnark wants.
If you use this spell, you get
a description of a given card,
number of holders, and total
number of cards in existence.
I want one!
Continue!
Next time: A x Hard x Master.
My master is Wing-san!
My master is—
P-Pow!
Another bump on the head...
﻿I'm the pro Hunter Biscuit Krueger.
I'm not big on formalities,
so call me Bisky.
In return, you must obey every
word of what I teach you.
No way. And no, thanks.
We're not desperate enough to beg
a total stranger to train us!
Say something, Gon.
We have Wing-san.
Right, right.
We already have a master,
and we don't need anyone else to teach us.
Wing?
You mean that little boy with
messy hair and glasses?
The one who never tucks in his shirt?
Do you know him?
Do I know him?
Wing's one of my students.
Seriously?
That's awesome!
So he's become a master now...
Time really flies, huh?
Does that mean you're pro Hunters?
Oh, just me.
You've passed the secret exam?
Yep.
That really takes me back...
I'd love to serve as an examiner again.
Well, I'm essentially your master's master,
so you shouldn't have any
problems with my teaching you.
A x Hard x Master
Wow!
You've been an examiner!
Assuming that she's telling the truth.
You're a stubborn little boy.
I like to see that in kids.
You said that you weren't desperate, right?
Book.
That card...
Marimo-chi
A super-fast ball-like
creature about as hard
as rubber. Deals little
damage, but can be
annoying if it smacks
you in the face.
Look carefully.
Its difficulty to obtain is ranked D.
It's a normal card that doesn't
go in a restricted slot.
The problem is that
there are many people who
could have effortlessly
obtained this card, while you two could not.
If you run into someone who's
stronger and has evil intentions...
Sit down...
Pretend that we're chatting.
There's an enemy behind me.
Three kids?
I'll cut them apart.
Don't probe for him.
He'll notice.
How did you sense him?
He let a tiny bit of bloodlust escape.
The enemy saw a bunch of kids,
and he relaxed for a second.
Doesn't that mean he's weak?
He immediately concealed his presence again.
It was only the slightest bloodlust,
and he quickly concealed it,
so he's pretty good.
We couldn't even sense his presence,
let alone locate him.
What should we do?
He's fast on the uptake!
This boy's bright.
What do you think?
We three should move together.
Why do you say that?
I'm guessing he decided to use caution
because there are three of us.
If we stick together,
he'll be less eager to attack.
I agree.
Well, you're right.
But that's not what we're going to do.
If I go off on my own,
the enemy is one hundred percent
guaranteed to attack me.
I'll go south. You boys, go north.
Walk five hundred meters without
concealing your presences.
Aim for that pillar.
Once you get there, use Zetsu,
then rush back immediately!
Okay, stalk the stalkerâ€”
Huh?
Fine, then! Be that way!
Damned hag...
I've had enough!
Bye-bye.
Yeah, get lost!
We didn't want you around!
Come on, Gon!
Let's go.
Oh, they're acting.
So long, stupid!
That woman really is something.
Huh?
I was on full alert,
so I'd be ready to react at a moment's notice.
But I didn't realize what she'd done
until my cheek began to sting.
Let's hurry back.
Yeah.
I just cut your hair...
With my Scissor Hands!
When I eat the hair I cut,
I can learn things about the owner's body
that they don't even know about themselves.
Muscle tone, potential for
disease, genetic strengths!
I will learn everything about your body
before I begin to toy with it...
Age fifty-seven?!
And she looks like this?
What's even scarier is how honed her body is.
I can see
her physical appearance conceals
the strength she's achieved
through intensive training.
My fighter's spirit insists that
I challenge you to a duel.
I guess you aren't a total deviant.
Very well.
You're lucky.
If I'd used my Nen, you would be dead.
During that battle, what did you see first?
The guy being flipped through the air.
Same here.
Her opponent wasn't weak by any means.
She's just that strong!
If he were an in-game character,
he'd have a D rank in terms of difficulty.
It would have been an instant
game over for you boys.
That makes the second time
I've seen you barely escape death.
How long will your good fortune last?
Bisky-san...
Just call me Bisky.
If you insist on an honorific,
call me Bisky-chama!
I'll just call you Hag.
Why are you here, Bisky?
Well, I'm here to clear the game,
but I'm mainly after a jewel.
A jewel?
There's a jewel that can only be found here.
Blue Planet
A gemstone with an
incomparable blue shine.
Its composition matches
no known minerals,
so it's named for its
otherworldly nature.
It goes in restricted slot #81...
Blue Planet.
What about you boys?
We're here to clear the game, obviously.
Actually, my dad made this game.
Oh?
I'm looking for my dad,
so I thought this game might contain a lead.
Who's your dad?
Ging Freecss.
Ging?!
You know him?
You bet I do!
He's famous.
Chairman Netero once said
he was one of the top five Nen users...
Bisky, if you'd be willing to
postpone your treasure hunt,
please teach us Nen!
You've finally come around?
I'm a lot tougher than Wing.
Are you ready?
Yes!
What about you?
I'll be fine.
Take out all your cards.
Book.
I'm going to give you a chance.
You must evade their attacks for two weeks!
If you're successful, I'll let you escape.
If you're knocked unconscious or can't stand...
I will kill you.
I just have to avoid their attacks, right?
It doesn't matter what I do to them?
Sure.
But there's one rule.
You aren't allowed to leave this crater.
If you break this rule, you lose,
and I'll kill you.
What about us?
The same rules apply.
If you leave, or fail to defeat
him after two weeks,
you'll be punished.
You're the Bounty Hunter Binolt, right?
Yeah.
There's a bounty on his head, as well.
He's a brutal murderer.
Begin!
Why are you standing around?
He's trying to heal up!
Are you going to let him?
If he weren't injured,
I would have lost my eye!
We can't get close to him...
Should I use this?
But while I charge up, he won't stay still.
Gon, let's make this a battle of attrition.
Attrition?
You get some rest.
I'll keep an eye on him, and use these to attack.
We'll switch every six hours.
Rocks?
That's a good idea.
That's exactly what I need...
If I can rest like this for a week,
I'll be more or less recovered.
Once I'm healed, I can finish them off.
He's using the rock as a shield!
Correct!
You boys can't beat him in a drawn-out fight.
Makes sense.
Damn!
They have too much stamina!
I won't have any time to rest!
Binolt may be injured,
but making him uncomfortable
in half a day is still impressive.
They're conscious that their lives
are on the line in this fight.
Not bad at all.
These boys are raw gems!
That rock-hard conviction in his eyes.
That hidden, bottomless potential.
If properly cut through training,
he can be completely transformed...
Like a diamond!
And this boy is a cool, calm blue.
He may look fragile,
but with the right amount of heat, he can
achieve semi-permanent strength...
Like a sapphire!
Why does my heart skip
whenever I see something
waiting to be polished?
I'll train them well!
What?
A forest of rocks.
It impedes their enemy,
while concealing their presences.
This won't take two weeks.
They'll finish it in a day.
Game over, pops!
Stop, Killua!
Why did you stop me, Gon?
We still have plenty of time.
Let's continue until we're both
able to take him alone.
Huh?
Stopping now would be a waste.
Because we're on a roll.
Fool...
It's my turn.
I'll slice you up!
Sure, but let's wait until tomorrow.
You should get some rest.
You've been slowing down.
True.
If it takes both of us to beat a single
injured, exhausted man,
we won't stand a chance
against any of the rest.
You won't be able to fool their
acute antennae now.
Binolt, your potential pales
in comparison to theirs.
Oh, my wallet's missing.
Really? You had it a moment ago.
Excuse me...
You dropped this...
Day two...
He's slowing down.
No, we're getting faster.
Practice pays off that much more
when you're fighting an equal for your life.
Damn...
Damn!
I never...
I never wanted
to live this way!
That's why I was against this!
You're the one who said
this would be a shortcut.
Now it's my fault?
Look at my clothes...
They're dirty now.
I wasn't looking for a reward...
I wasn't expecting any gratitude...
I just...
That's enough.
There's no way I can defeat you.
Kill me.
Why? We won't kill you.
You've helped us make a lot of progress.
Thank you, Binolt-san!
I only wanted
to lead a normal life.
Go on.
Once I leave, I'll turn myself in.
Gon...
You're flawless,
a perfect gem.
But that pure nature could be your undoing.
Well, let's head for Masadora.
Osu!
The number 9!
Too slow!
Give me three thousand push-ups.
Damn...
Masadora's about seventy kilometers away.
That's a three-hour trip, at most.
Seriously?
Oh, there it is!
City of Magic
Masadora
Let's find a department store now!
They're only selling cards...
Sorry for the wait.
Let's return to that rocky area.
What?!
Gain!
These are the cards you bought?
Yep.
We'll head back to Masadora now.
However,
we'll go in a straight line!
Huh? A straight line?
You can't mean...
Yep!
It's time to dig!
The rock isn't as hard as I was expecting.
Yeah, this should go pretty smoothly.
This is rough...
No more...
Hold on.
If you're going to rest, sit properly.
Huh?
Starting today, you must always
sleep in this position.
Don't let go of the rope.
There's a chance I might cut the rope,
so keep a portion of your
brain alert while you sleep.
My old man put me through this
kind of training all the time.
Ow!
Okay, when it falls,
you have to put it back up.
Gon, your head...
I'm good...
I'll be making them bigger.
Gon...
I'm good!
Ow!
We've run into a really hard rock.
Can we dig it up?
I don't think a shovel will work.
I can probably break it with a Nen punch.
What's wrong?
Killua, what were you doing with
your aura while digging?
I wasn't doing anything unusual.
Think of the shovel as part of your body!
I see.
If we shroud the shovel in aura,
our digging will be stronger!
Wow! The rock's as soft as pudding!
Okay! Let's keep on digging!
They've learned a new application of Ten, Shu!
Surround
Once we reach Masadora,
they'll have completed the first stage.
How will Bisky's grueling training
transform the two boys?
G.I. Tutorial
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!
Today, we're introducing the card Blue Planet.
Blue Planet
A gemstone with an
incomparable blue shine.
Its composition matches
no known minerals,
so it's named for its
otherworldly nature.
It's one of the reasons Bisky is playing the game.
She's going through all this just for a stone?
That hag has weird taste...
Continue!
Next time: Strengthen x And x Threaten.
Strengthen!
Ahem!
Don't threaten!
Ahem!
﻿All right!
We made it through!
Good work!
I think we've gone five kilometers today.
At first, I thought it would take years,
but at this pace...
Masadora!
Take two!
Okay!
Let's return to the starting point now.
Again?!
Strengthen x And x Threaten
Next, we'll work on obtaining monster cards.
You have the requisite physical strength
to defeat every enemy here.
What you lack
is the ability to come up with
a plan of attack as you fight.
In other words, the ability to strategize.
The ability to...
...strategize.
I'm not going to say a single word,
so devise your own means
to defeat the monsters.
Still, the people who made this
game really were special...
The game's programmed in such a way
that you're guaranteed to get
stronger as you progress.
And, most likely, all for the purpose
of making him stronger.
Yes!
I got the Marimo-chi!
Nen battles require one to fight
against many different enemy types.
The ability to think on your feet
is the most critical technique.
First, get used to thinking all the time,
until your thinking is tied to your reflexes.
This game is a training program
to help you achieve that.
The hardest monster in this
area is the Bubble Horse.
If they clear that hurdle,
they'll complete the second stage!
Zetsu!
Caught it!
I got a Bubble Horse!
Way to go.
Yep!
When it comes to analysis and
physical strength, Killua's stronger.
But Gon makes up for it with his
concentration and recovery speed.
They make a perfect team!
Okay, we'll now begin to
work on your defense.
Is that...
That's right, Gon.
This is the technique you've been using.
Ten
Ten, Zetsu, Ren, Hatsu, and Gyo
Zetsu
Ren
Hatsu
Gyo
are combined in this technique.
Ko!
Ko
You focus all of your aura into one
part of your body, then attack.
This gives it far greater power
than your regular attacks.
I'm going to attack with my fist.
You must block my attacks.
You may not dodge.
You've figured it out?
That's right...
If you use your aura to block normally,
you'll take considerable damage.
So what should you do?
We should use Ko, too.
You're half right.
Ko against Ko.
As long as you and your opponent
are similar in Nen capacity,
you'll escape unscratched.
However...
If your opponent hits you in a place
where you weren't using Ko,
you'll be destroyed.
Then we should use Ko on our entire body.
Though it's contradictory.
Exactly.
This technique combines Ten and Ren.
Ken.
Ken
You defend yourself
by shrouding your body in
much more aura than usual.
It isn't as strong as Ko,
but it's far more practical.
Gon, use Ren.
To sustain that for a prolonged
period is called Ken.
Now protect yourself from my punch!
So slow.
You must have relaxed when you
saw how slowly I was moving.
If you'd stopped using Ken,
your face would have been smashed.
That was the power of Ko alone.
When I add the speed and power
packed by a normal punch,
it becomes many times stronger.
Even dozens of times stronger.
I'll start by going slowly,
but you won't get any warning.
Keep using Ken, and try to
withstand my attacks.
Gon!
Hmm, that was almost two minutes...
I had no idea it could be this
hard to keep up my Nen.
You need to be able to sustain
Ken for at least thirty minutes,
or you won't stand a chance.
Okay, we're through!
Learning to use Ken!
Good, that was thirty minutes!
Over the past month,
you've become a lot tougher.
The number 3!
Bingo!
Killua was slightly faster.
Gon, give me a thousand push-ups.
Okay, we'll begin actual
combat training today.
Ken!
In your current state, your attack
power is 50, defense 50.
So if you fight each other while using Ken,
you won't be able to deal much damage.
What should you do?
Use Ko!
You fool.
What if he hits you where
you aren't using Ko?
Use Gyo?
Correct!
From your current 50-50 state,
at the moment of attack,
you shift your fist to 70 POW,
and the rest to 30 POW.
You can use Gyo to alter your POW
depending on the situation.
This is Ryu!
Ryu
Let's get started...
Right hand to 70 POW,
rest of your body to 30 POW!
It doesn't have to be precise, so try it out.
Left leg to 80 POW,
rest of your body to 20 POW!
Head to 60 POW,
rest of your body to 40 POW!
Do this for thirty minutes, three times a day.
Add it to your current training menu.
Also...
We'll begin sparring now.
Use Ryu the way I just taught you.
You can start out slow.
When you're on the defensive,
determine your opponent's attack power
before defending with Ryu.
With that said...
Begin!
I'll go first, then.
Right leg, 55 POW.
Right leg, 60 POW, I think...
Left hand, 60 POW.
Right fist, 80 POW!
Left elbow, 80 POW!
If they keep this up daily, for two months,
they'll be able to fight at
full speed while using Ryu.
After that, it'll be time for the final stage.
Okay!
Time for a break!
Thank you very much!
Osu!
It's been two weeks.
They've made a lot of progress...
It appears you're ready for the final stage.
The final stage?
Yes, you will begin training in
the individual categories.
3!
Bingo!
A draw.
You're free to train solely in your own category.
In the case of an Enhancer...
Enhancer
Mani.           Emit.          Enha.         Tran.         Conj.
You'd want to focus on your Enhancer skills,
while training the nearby categories
of Transmuter and Emitter in a balanced fashion.
Then you'll master your own category faster.
9!
Bingo!
A draw.
Good job, Killua.
Same to you.
Then, let's get started.
Osu!
Today, we'll be training in
the Enhancer category.
Level 1 is smashing rocks.
Crush them like this.
Smash a thousand with a single stone
in a day, and you clear the level.
And begin!
This is pretty tough.
All I'm doing is
changing the stone to 100 POW
at the moment of impact.
But my Nen is weakening as I go.
Oops, it crumbled...
If the stone in your hand breaks, it's over.
Damn!
Damn, I failed!
What are you talking about?
You did well.
Okay!
Let's do Transmuter training next.
Now, now, don't rush.
You're only allowed to train
one category per day.
6!
Bingo! A draw.
Again?
These days, we keep getting draws.
That just shows that you've both
grown accustomed to using Gyo.
But if there's no winner, it's no fun.
Okay, then we'll decide
with rock-paper-scissors.
The loser does a thousand push-ups!
Sure.
First comes rock...
Rock, paper, scissors!
One more time!
I win!
Damn!
Hey, boys...
Have you heard the theory that
rock-paper-scissors began in martial arts?
Huh?
Palm
Paper represents a palm attack that
wrecks the opponent's organs.
Fingers
Scissors represents a finger jab,
targeting vital points.
Fist
And rock represents a punch with
the fist to deal external damage.
Evil Fist
Long ago, when martial arts were mistaken
as purely destructive and banned as an evil art,
martial artists trained by playing this game.
And that's how rock-paper-scissors came to be.
You really are old...
That's it!
Eh?
Evil Fist.
Now, everyone.
We have a total of 133 cards from
90 of the 100 total restricted slot cards.
This is the product of your hard work.
You have our thanks.
Of the remaining 10 cards, we've located 7.
They're as good as ours.
However, Tsezgerra's group has also obtained
an equal number of restricted slot cards.
The final hurdle will likely be a
showdown against their group.
But I believe we have more,
and better, spell cards!
Gentlemen, our victory is near!
Can I say something?
These five years have been
so long, yet so short...
There's something I must tell you.
I am the Bomber.
What? The Bomber?
H-Hey, what are you talking about?
Now, now... Hear me out.
I've placed bombs on all of you.
What was that?
How did you do that?!
Don't mess with us!
Stay calm and listen.
Good grief.
You ruined the explanation I'd planned.
This is my power...
Little Flower.
Fistful of Gunpowder
Little Flower
As you just saw,
I can blow up anything I grab with my hand.
But it isn't very strong.
He's still alive.
However,
if the bombs on your bodies explode,
you will die.
A bomb? Where is it?
I will now tell you how to disarm the bombs.
Let's start with how I set them.
That was by touching the place on
the target I wanted to explode,
and saying a certain keyword.
The keyword is
"Bomber."
It was the Bomber again.
Listen... Beware of the Bomber.
In order to disarm the bombs,
you must touch my body and say,
"I caught the Bomber."
However, I also have the Little Flower ability.
I can use this to stop anyone
who tries to touch me.
You must be very careful as you
attempt to disarm the bombs.
That's all.
They're armed.
This is the ability Countdown.
Sound of Life
Countdown
Why am I telling you so
much about my powers?
That's the condition for arming the bombs.
Then you've been waiting for
the day when all the cards
and members were gathered.
Now, I have a proposition.
I will trade your lives for those
90 restricted slot cards.
If you agree, I will use an alternative method,
and simultaneously disarm all the bombs.
Do nothing, and all of you will die
when the counter reaches zero.
You should discuss this amongst yourselves.
I'll be waiting for you at
Mr. Battera's old mansion.
I don't care who comes, but come alone.
Are you insane?
If we just catch you now and
disarm the bombs, it's all over.
Do you think you can escape alone?!
Calm yourselves...
If you get too excited,
the countdown will accelerate.
Because the counter is linked
to your heartbeat.
What?
Book!
Crap!
I pray we meet again!
Leave
Send one target player
off the island.
[SR][NORM]
Leave on!
He escaped outside the game!
We have to follow him...
Wait!
If we leave, the cards inside
our binders will vanish!
Then what do we do?
Calm down!
It would be unwise to chase him down!
Have you forgotten why we teamed up?
Because we aren't strong fighters!
Does anyone here think they're
strong enough to defeat him?
It would be impossible.
Given his Nen abilities, he must be powerful.
If all of us attacked him together,
he could use Little Flower to defeat us all.
Damn, we were so close!
First, we must reach a consensus.
Do we hand over the cards?
Or do we fight?
Please give him the cards...
I beg you.
Jispa's running out of time...
That's a surprise.
I was expecting Nickes to come.
I'm surprised, too.
I didn't expect you to be alone...
Sub and Bara.
They're the other bombers.
Now give me your ring.
What's wrong?
I can't turn it over yet...
Actually, we still haven't reached a decision.
And Nickes has requested the Breath
of Archangel card to save Jispa.
Screw that!
As it stands, neither side can win this!
Eh?
You don't realize how hysterical they are.
If they can't make a decision before
time expires and they explode,
you'll lose the data in their rings!
But I can—
But you can convince them?
Are you trying to bargain with me?
When striking a bargain,
you have to demonstrate just
how calm and insane you are.
W-Wait...
If you kill me...
Don't worry.
If you kill a player outside the
game and take their ring,
the restricted slot data will not vanish.
Well, I doubt you have any of the cards.
A gift.
Puhat!
You won't get another chance.
Okay?
Leave...
The spell card! Leave!
I need to exit, so give it to me.
Hell, no!
Leave is a valuable card.
We can't waste any!
Okay, then...
If I don't return,
it won't be possible to disarm all
your bombs simultaneously.
What?
I'm also a bomber.
There are three of us.
Well, Genthru's the main one,
and we're just extras.
When the three of us join our
right thumbs and say the keyword,
the bombs will be destroyed.
That's the alternative method.
Whatever...
I'll take my time returning
via normal means.
You guys will be dead soon.
Wait! Hold on!
Please use this.
You should have done that
in the first place, scum!
We'll need Leave cards
when the deal is made.
Have three ready.
Got it?
Twelve hours before Genthru
revealed himself as the Bomber,
a single boat attempted to
invade from the outside.
So it does exist in the real world.
That's gotta be Greed Island.
G.I. Tutorial
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!
Today, we introduce the card Leave.
Leave
Send one target player
off the island.
[SR][NORM]
This takes us back to the real world?
That's nice.
If you're going out, leave the free slot cards.
Stupid onliner!
Huh?
Continue!
Next time: Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.
See ya here next week!
Rock, paper, scissors!
﻿So, then...
Where are we on the island?
Let's steal an Accompany card and go.
Uninvited guests?
I'm getting nervous...
Just so we're clear,
you didn't wash up on shore, right?
After all, if you'd let the waves carry you,
it would be impossible to reach this island.
This guy's strong.
Who are you?
Are you supposed to be our tour guide?
I'm one of the designers of this game.
The name's Razor.
I mainly handle the Emitter spells,
including all movement via spells
and dealing with external threats.
Eliminate
Send all trespassers
on Greed Island to a
random location on
the Azian continent
[LR][SP]
This is a special spell only usable by Game Masters.
Sorry, but you'll have to leave.
You're more than welcome to
visit via official channels.
From there, if you defeat me,
you can receive an item.
Should you decide to play,
we'll probably get to fight eventually.
Sounds good...
We'll come back.
Through the front door.
Eliminate on.
Hmm, those were some strong Nen users...
Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors
As Gon continues to train,
he discovers a hint to developing
a new technique, and that is...
First comes rock!
Rock... Paper...
Rock!
I see.
Here comes the next one!
First comes rock!
Rock... Paper...
Paper!
Bisky, how do I make my Nen fly?
Train more!
So paper is an Emitter technique?
Uh-huh.
And Scissors is a Transmuter technique.
I wanna be able to cut through rock.
I understand.
That's a reasonable fighting technique.
But such a childish idea.
You know how it takes time
to focus Nen in my fist?
I was trying to think of a good
way to spend that time.
And when you were talking about
rock-paper-scissors, it hit me.
Because I like rock-paper-scissors.
Trusting your instincts is important.
Your gut plays a big role in
techniques that require
multiple Nen categories.
The key is that it should feel right to you.
Ah... Ahem.
Well, this is all I can manage right now,
but if I charge it up, it's pretty strong.
That's awesome, Killua!
You're like an electric eel!
That's a horrible comparison!
He can already change Nen into
electricity at such a young age?
Frightening...
And very tragic...
His childhood must have been a living hell.
It's a miracle that he can smile now.
Indeed...
They make a great team.
Well, let's take a break, then.
It's a little early, but we can have a party.
A party?
What do you boys do back home to celebrate?
Celebrate?
In the outside world, it's almost New Year's.
Time flows at the same speed
inside the game as outside.
Oops!
The deadline to apply for the
Hunter Exam is coming up!
And our training was just starting to get fun...
I believe you're required to apply
before the end of the year.
We need to hurry.
How do we get outside?
I'm guessing there are spell
cards to leave the game?
In that case, let's head to Masadora.
Agreed!
Well, let's find a place to have a drink.
We can't... There's no time.
We can ask around the stores.
How to leave the island?
That'll be 3,000 Jenny.
If you go about fifty kilometers west,
you'll reach the island's only port.
You must defeat or bribe
the chief of that port
to receive a ticket that will
transport you outside.
How big of a bribe are we talking?
Depends on how the chief's feeling.
Ah...
Your other option is to
use a Leave spell card,
but that's a rare one.
What do we do?
Let's head for the port.
If it's a rare card, we could buy
a bunch without finding one.
True.
Passage Ticket
Voilà.
Well, I'll go pass the test real
quick, and then hurry back.
There are monsters called Kiriko
that live beneath a cedar tree
on the mountain behind Dolle Harbor.
If you tell them you're my friend,
they'll take you to the exam area.
Okay.
See ya.
Then let's get back to training.
Osu!
Welcome.
Is this where I started?
No, it's not...
The girl looks similar, though.
Well, that's not so unusual in games.
You are leaving the island, right?
Please select a destination.
Do you know Dolle Harbor?
Yes, I do.
Then send me there.
Understood.
When you leave this island,
the cards in your free slots will disappear.
Is that okay?
Yeah, it's fine.
Then we shall await your return.
I'm back in the real world now?
Doesn't feel that way.
Book.
Oh, it doesn't work out here.
Once I submit my application,
I'll head for that cedar tree.
First, I should shower and
change into fresh clothes.
Okay, train while you run!
When you can form the numbers from 0 to 9
in one minute, you'll clear this stage.
That hurt!
What are you doing?
Aren't you...
Your other friend isn't here?
What's that machine on your shoulder?
Did something happen?
We were fooled by the Bomber.
Will you listen to my story?
So he was the Bomber...
The others are waiting at our base for
the Bomber to disarm the bombs.
They believe the terms he gave them,
even though it was probably a bluff.
Can't anything be done?
If they're prepared to accept casualties...
It's impossible.
The first people to attack
will be the ones who die.
Who would volunteer for that role?
True...
Jispa was our group's strongest fighter,
and he was defeated in an instant.
At that point, our loss was assured.
And allowing him to leave the game
was a fatal mistake.
We indulged in a moment's victory cheer
before we could verify each
member's cards and assign roles.
That's when he caught us off guard.
It's embarrassing to admit,
but I was so distracted,
I didn't notice him using Leave
until it was already too late.
You were probably focused on
understanding his explanation.
Yeah.
We were thrust into that
situation with no warning.
Given our mental state, there was
no action we could have taken.
But why are you telling us this?
Because, of everyone I've met on this island,
you are the ones I believe I can most rely on.
If you run into any other players,
please tell them about the Bomber.
Once everyone knows how his ability works,
they should be able to protect themselves.
And if possible, I would
like you to avenge us!
If not,
could you at least promise that
you won't let him clear the game?
Yeah.
Understood.
Sorry...
I'll use what time I have remaining
to tell as many as I can about the Bomber.
Book.
Return on.
Bunzen!
Just kidding...
The truth is that they were
the only players I could find
using Magnetic Force.
Even a pig can climb a tree if
you give it enough praise.
Every thousandth of a percent counts
when it comes to deactivating someone's Nen.
Well, Nickes probably left to
meet with the bombers.
If the mass disarmament
turns out to be a mass explosion...
I should get started.
You're finally here.
Now give me your ring.
Jispa's dead.
That's nice. Your ring.
Disarm everyone's bombs first!
Hell, no.
I have to enter the game with your ring,
and confirm that the cards
really are all inside.
I'll disarm the bombs after that.
I'll give you one more chance.
Hand over the ring.
Sub, put it on.
If you put on a second ring outside the game,
you'll overwrite the data.
Now, let's head back inside together.
Wait, what was your name?
Migamura, Samingadura,
Interaminga, Zenberarubura.
Spirits of the forest,
remove the tainted Nen that resides within me.
Now, then...
What horrors will come of this?
I borrow power from the forest spirits,
to use my Conjurer ability
to create a Nen beast, capable of
consuming other people's Nen!
It's huge!
The Bomber's Countdown must be
a particularly strong technique.
How'd it go?
Has he disarmed the bombs yet?
Book.
81 restricted slot card types.
They're all here, all right.
We did as you requested...
Disarm the bombs!
But of course.
I'm a man of my word.
But first, hand over three Leave cards.
Okay, we have a deal.
Sub... Bara...
Let's do this.
Release.
I released you
from your terror.
Th-That wasn't the deal...
Why should I keep a promise
I made to a bunch of scum?
Release was the signal to explode, not disarm.
Leave on!
At least now, I don't have
to worry about exploding.
But until Genthru reverses his ability or dies,
this thing won't disappear.
I have a troublesome partner now...
Hey, stop moving!
The Bomber thinks he killed us all.
I'll let him believe that...
Until I make my move!
Bisky...
I think we should drop by
their base real fast.
They already ran out of time.
Besides, he didn't even
tell us exactly where it is.
And even if we did know,
we don't have a spell card
that could take us there.
I know.
But some of them might have
survived the explosion...
Doubt it.
If the Bomber's strong enough to place bombs
on all his targets without anyone noticing,
he wouldn't have made that kind of mistake.
However...
If we continue to play this game,
we'll probably run into the Bomber.
Given that, we may need
to visit their base soon.
Uh-huh.
We need spell cards.
Let's go to Masadora and
sell our monster cards
to buy spell cards.
Yeah!
Hey, Bisky...
How long do you think it'll take me
to master my special technique?
You're just starting to develop your Nen.
It's hard to predict when your
power and speed will peak.
Oh...
But it shouldn't take too long
before you get the form down.
Really? How long?
Let's see...
Hopefully, you'll have it ready
by the time Killua returns.
All right!
I'll finish my technique and surprise him!
You two are lucky!
We just received a huge
shipment of spell cards.
These are the spell cards they'd gathered.
We bought sixty between us,
so there are lots of different types.
Look.
Prison
All slotted cards on target
page are immune to theft
or destruction via spell
card until removed.
(Only targets pages 1 - 11.
Free slot pages
cannot be targeted.)
[DEF][CONT]
An S-rank card...
There are only ten in the whole game!
What do you think?
Should we save it?
Or use it now?
I don't know what to do!
Shh!
You're too loud...
People will get suspicious!
If only Killua were here...
I can smell Gon on you.
I'd like to see him again...
We'll take you to the exam site.
I need to zip on over and
breeze through the exam,
so I can hurry back to Gon.
But the exam won't begin for a few days.
Oh, right.
In the meantime, you can tell
us about yourself and Gon.
Okay.
I'll start with the story about
when he came to visit my home.
You're making steady progress.
You're on track to have your
special technique ready.
This is a safe place to practice.
Since we'll be able to spot anyone
before they're in attack spell range.
I can sense people watching from Masadora,
just like I sensed people
watching us at the start point.
But we have plenty of defense spells now.
Well, just to be safe,
I used a Blackout Curtain card.
Blackout Curtain
Block one instance of enemy Steal or Fluoroscopy.
(Does not stack when used on target already under
effect of Blackout Curtain.)
[DEF][CONT]
But no point in worrying about spell cards.
Just focus on training hard.
Osu!
Okay, one minute's up.
Next.
It didn't work.
I can't reach it...
That was just fine.
You're in far better shape than
a Transmuter would be!
Be patient, and start by focusing
on maintaining your aura
in a sphere for extended periods of time.
Osu!
The longer you can maintain the
sphere, the stronger your Ten.
Once you've trained long enough,
you'll be able to maintain an aura
sphere for two to three days!
You should be able to reach that
stone before the day's out.
You're right! I reached it!
That was fast!
This proves he's been hard at work
on his Ten and Ren every day.
Then, we'll go back to practicing the basics.
Osu!
Gon continues to train with Bisky,
to master his special technique.
Killua has temporarily left the game
to retake the Hunter Exam.
The two boys are working
hard toward their goals.
G.I. Tutorial
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!
Today, we introduce the card Blackout Curtain.
Blackout Curtain
Block one instance of enemy Steal
or Fluoroscopy. (Does not stack
when used on target already
under effect of Blackout Curtain.)
[DEF][CONT]
With this card,
other players can't see inside your binder.
You can see inside my binder
whenever you want, Killua.
What?!
Continue!
Next time: Strategy x And x Scheme.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Gon-kun!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Killua-kun!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, show me what you've got!
﻿Once someone comes out,
follow their directions.
It's been fun.
Good luck.
Yeah, thank you.
Is this Mikhail's residence?
Go do some shopping at
Dick Sakura, by the station.
At check out, give the cashier this card.
Please come this way, sir.
Strategy x And x Scheme
There are more people this time.
I wonder if there's anyone I know.
Yo.
Last year, you had your way with us.
But that won't happen again.
We've undergone some hellish training.
Our teamwork is perfect now.
Thank you for coming!
This year, 1,489 applicants
have made it this far,
but the Phase Two examiner has asked me
to trim that number to about 300.
As for the exam...
There are two hours before lunch.
Defeat five people before then.
Grab their tags when you defeat them,
and see me when you have all five.
I'll wait on the other side of the door.
Got it?
As soon as I shut the door,
you may start.
Every stage of the exam should be like this...
You've gotta be strong to be a Hunter.
Oh, you're here!
Killuâ€”
Sucks for you.
I'm the only one passing this year.
He's totally out of our league...
So that's what it takes to
become a top Hunter...
This will be the last time I
attempt the Hunter Exam...
We finally have our first applicant.
That took an hour and a half.
What happened to everyone else?
They're all asleep.
It took me a while to collect all their tags.
Is there going to be a second stage?
That won't be necessary.
He's demonstrated his skill.
Killua, denizen of the darkness...
He's returned much stronger.
Applicant 1219, Killua-kun.
Yeah.
You've passed
the Hunter Exam!
Welcome back, Killua.
How was the exam?
I passed it in no time, naturally.
Yay!
Sorry to interrupt your celebration,
but look at these spell cards.
Wow...
There's even an S-rank card!
How much can we sell it for?
Oh, let's go ask around!
No, we should use it wisely.
So what should we do?
Well, I guess it's safe to hold on to it.
With all these defensive spells,
we don't need to worry
about it getting stolen.
Have you tried any of these?
Just Blackout Curtain.
What?
If you have all these cards,
you should use them...
Start by using this one.
You can choose a player you've
met before, and talk to them.
Contact
Communicate with one target
player (encountered within the
game) via your Book.
(Connection maintained for
a maximum of 3 minutes.
May only be broken by
player who used this card.)
[LR][NORM]
Who should we talk to?
We won't know until we see who's available.
Contact on!
Oh, I see a lot of names.
Hey, Gon...
When did you run into him?
Huh?
Chrollo Lucilfer
Chrollo?
Who's Chrollo?
I haven't seen Chrollo inside the game.
Does that mean you guys passed
each other without noticing?
Huh? What are you talking about?
That doesn't make sense.
Kurapika sealed his Nen.
Yeah, and you have to use
Nen to enter the game.
Who's Kurapika?!
That only leaves...
Let me in on this!
I get it. So that's what's going on.
Hey, Shal...
Stop laughing, and explain
what this is about.
Sorry about that.
Chrollo Lucilfer
This probably isn't the boss.
He hasn't purged the Nen from his body.
Purging Nen?
It's very doable.
Seriously?
Of course!
If you can place Nen on others,
it's not unreasonable to think
Nen can be removed, as well.
Does that mean Chrollo has removed
Kurapika's Nen, and entered the game?
Why would he be here?
I'm not sure,
but we should probably let Kurapika know.
I'll leave the game real quick.
You can use a spell card to leave.
Save it.
I can be out and back in four hours.
I should have realized this sooner...
Yorknew City                                        Greed Island
This island is directly east of Yorknew City.
East is the direction to go.
You will find one who awaits you.
I see.
So the boss came here to find
someone to purge that Nen.
The boss arrived the same way we did,
but then Razor kicked him out.
That was when he realized
this was Greed Island.
But since the boss can't use Nen,
he can't enter the island
via the usual channels.
So he must have hired someone
to come to this island for him.
He had them use his name
as a hidden message to us.
The one who can purge this
Nen is on Greed Island.
Change in plans again...
Let's bring everyone else here.
Yes, we'll all start looking
for this Nen exorcist.
I have a small correction.
You're...
Hisoka!
It was my idea to use Chrollo's name.
Because I didn't know you could
enter any name you like
until I was already inside...
You should praise my initiative.
Since I helped you understand Chrollo's message.
Ah, so that's what this is about.
I'm dying to kill you right here and now,
but I'll let the boss do that.
Well, if anything comes up,
use Contact to get in touch.
If I learn anything new, I'll let you know.
Bye.
So the boss hired Hisoka...
He probably didn't have much
choice, but it's still weird.
And his reward is probably a duel,
once the boss is cleansed.
But now, it's only a matter of time
until the boss comes back!
I doubt it.
I would know at once
if Nen I placed on a spider
had been removed.
So when you chose your power, you
knew something like this might happen?
Of course...
If you're able to place Nen on others,
it only makes sense to assume
that one can also remove Nen.
Well, now you know.
What you do from here is up to you.
Thanks for taking the trouble.
You have my gratitude.
Did you need anything?
What am I...
What am I supposed to do this month?
Tell me...
What should I do?
It'll be fine. Let me handle...
What could you possibly know?
You have no idea what's going
to happen to us now!
Neon... I need Neon!
Restore Neon at once!
Damn! Why did this happen?
I wonder what's wrong...
Why did it stop working?
See ya.
Looks like it's not the real Chrollo.
Oh...
Kurapika was pretty calm about it.
Like he wasn't concerned or just didn't care.
Well, it sounds like you
got worried for nothing.
Now it's time to focus on yourselves.
Osu!
Start with the basics...
We're not going to train.
It's time to start
beating this game!
It's said the legendary King Great White Beetle
lives only on this tree!
There's only one way to capture it!
Hit the tree hard enough to shake it out.
First comes rock!
Rock, paper...
Rock!
Wow!
It's raining bugs!
Found it.
Difficulty rank A!
King Great White Beetle
A legendary insect that
releases pheromones
which attract other insects
to start a massive colony.
Can only leave the colony
for brief evening walks.
That's three King Great White Beetle cards!
You could've gotten more if
you'd thrown a real punch.
Well, I didn't want to damage the tree.
There is no such girl in this mansion.
Even if there were, it would be impossible
for you to bypass all the traps and find her.
Found her.
She was in a hidden room,
four floors underground.
What?
Curse you!
Got an A-rank Gold Dust Girl!
Gold Dust Girl
A girl who releases golden dust.
One bath a day will net approx. 500 G.
Very shy and quiet.
The guard was a rank F.
Next, let's head to the
City of Gambling, Dorias!
Wait, wasn't today supposed to be
the monthly contest in Antokiba?
We'll be passing through, so let's give it a go.
Our winner is the Killua and Gon team.
A Paladin's Necklace! Score!
Paladin's Necklace
When a player wears this,
all spells targeting player
will be reflected.
Can also dispel curses
placed on any card
touched by player.
I don't understand this description.
We can ask one of the shopkeepers.
When you wear this necklace,
you can reflect all attack spells.
And if you touch cards under the
Transform
Change one card in your possession into any
other card in your possession. (Card will now
count against the limit of new card type. If limit has already been reached, nothing will happen,
and the Transform card will be destroyed.)
[SR][NORM]
Fake
Change Fake into any card type from 001 to 099.
The new card can be placed in a restricted pocket.
But it will not count toward Book completion,
and cannot be transformed into an item.
It also will not count toward card limit.
[SR][NORM]
effects of Transform or Fake,
you can restore them to their original state.
Wow...
If we wear this, we won't have to
worry about losing any cards.
Memory Helmet...
Memory Helmet
A player will always remember
everything seen or heard
while wearing this item.
Unfortunately, helmet is
very large and heavy.
Witch's Love Potion.
Witch's Love Potion
If player kisses a pill before
feeding it to a target, target will
become beholden to player.
Each pill will remain effective
for one week. Each bottle
contains 500 pills.
Risky Dice.
Risky Dice
A 20-sided die. One side says
Bad Luck, while the other nineteen
say Good Luck. If player rolls
Good Luck, something good will
happen. But if player rolls Bad Luck,
something bad will happen to cancel
out everything that was good.
King Great White Beetle.

Gold Dust Girl.

Paladin's Necklace

all spells targeting player
will be reflected.
Can also dispel curses
placed on any card
touched by player.
Paladin's Necklace.
A total of six different restricted slot cards!
Piece of cake!
Piece of cake?
Not in the least.
This was only possible because you
underwent that grueling training.
Another player has used Contact to reach you.
Yo. It's been a while, Gon.
Who are you?
You don't remember me?
Do you remember the player
who took the Sword of Truth
from you in Antokiba?
What do you want?
Up for a trade?
I have #66, Witch's Diet Pill,
and #17, VIP Multi-Pass.
You can talk it over with your friends.
What do you think?
Another player has used Contact to reach you.
It's Tsezgerra.
You again?
Interested in trading your
Breath of Archangel for our Patch of Forest?
It's an SS-rank card.
No way.
I've already said I won't
deal with you people.
What if I throw in a Clone?
I'm telling you that there's no deal here.
You already have ninety-two different cards.
All that's left
are the cards monopolized
by other players, yes?
Actually, we have ninety-five...
And you probably have many items
that you haven't used Gain on yet.
It's possible that Breath of Archangel
is the final card you need.
If we give that to you, we'll lose.
Stop playing dumb.
I know that you're monopolizing
both Breath of Archangel and Night Jade.
This game isn't over yet.
I see.
Good luck, then.
But we'll never let you have these cards.
What if I offer three cards?
We'll give you Patch of Forest,
Patch of Forest
The entrance to an enormous
forest known as the Mountain
God's Garden. Many species
exist only in this forest.
All are friendly to humans.
Hidden Hollow
Upon entering and exiting hollow,
player will be transported to a
desolate location. However, player can
return to original location
without spending any money.
Hidden Hollow,
Palmtop Dragon
As the name implies, this dragon
fits on your palm. Willingly obeys
its master. If raised lovingly,
it can learn to speak.
and Palmtop Dragon.
And you only have to give us Night Jade,
not Breath of Archangel.
We'd be giving you one SS-rank
card and two S-rank cards,
while you'd only give up one A-rank card.
I believe this deal is too good to pass up.
Give us some time to discuss this.
Just to be clear, this is our final offer.
We won't accept any further negotiation.
Book.
It's gotta be a trap.
That offer's too good.
Tsezgerra is a careful man.
He wouldn't try to pick a fight.
But at the same time, he would
never make a losing deal.
Breath of Archangel
An angel who can cure any mortal
injury or terminal disease with one breath.
However, angel will appear only once.
Meaning that he thinks
he can obtain a Breath of Archangel.
Does that mean they've assembled
all forty spell card types?
It's possible.
So they're waiting for Gain to be
used on a Breath of Archangel.
Night Jade
A jewel blessed by the devil.
When the holder is in danger,
peril will be shifted to another.
On the other hand, Night Jade is a card
that we monopolized through hard work.
If one of the cards were to be destroyed,
one of our jade jewels would
automatically turn into a card.
Which means the A-rank
Night Jade is much harder
for them to get than the
SS-rank Breath of Archangel.
This is a gamble.
Witch's Love Potion
If player kisses a pill before
feeding it to a target, target will
become beholden to player.
Each pill will remain effective
for one week. Each bottle
contains 500 pills.
VIP Multi-Pass
Present this pass to gain
entry into any location.
Contains 1000 passes.
Book.
See ya.
That was uneventful.
Kind of disappointing.
I was so nervous...
But now we've gathered
seven types, in three days!
We're making decent progress.
Okay, let's keep this up.
Are there any other events in the city
for getting restricted slot cards?
Hmm... I think there are...
Prizes from the slot machines?
Should've expected as much from
Dorias, the City of Gambling.
You have a 0.01% chance of winning.
That's one in ten thousand tries.
So it all comes down to luck.
Pretty risky.
I know, Gon!
Use that dice!
This is it...
If we get Good Luck, we can win!
But if you get Bad Luck,
something bad will happen that cancels out
everything good that's happened.
There's only a one in twenty
chance of getting Bad Luck.
There!
Next, we try the slot machine!
Awesome! One try!
Rainbow Diamond
A diamond that glitters like
a rainbow. If this diamond
is presented when proposing,
you will never be turned down.
A Rainbow Diamond! Score!
That's what I thought...
This die is the key to winning in this city.
But if you roll Bad Luck, it could be scary.
Don't worry.
It can't kill me...
Oh, no! A slot machine exploded!
I knew something was wrong.
That guy hit the jackpot five times in a row.
And he was acting weird...
He kept rolling a funny-looking die.
Yikes, his face is mush...
Anyway, let's make the trade.
Yeah, we want to get cards of rank S
and above as quickly as possible.
Yeah.
As for cards rank A and below...
Roll.
S-Spare me...
This is only your third time.
You'll be fine.
I-I know someone who got
Bad Luck on the first roll and died!
If I roll Bad Luck,
I'll be hit for every Good Luck
that the other players rolled!
Not my problem.
Roll.
Or would you rather die right now?
Come on...
See?
It's pretty rare to get Bad Luck.
Now we use the Lottery card.
We want #75, Lucky Alexandrite.
If you obtain one, we'll set you free.
C-Come on...
Lottery on!
Well?
#76!
So close!
Your luck sucks.
Okay, one more time!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Time for Motarike-kun to
show us what he's got!
No good, huh?
Hey, Gen.
Should we make the first move?
I already told you that combat
should be our last resort.
It's too early for that.
No, we're trying to stay
one step ahead of them.
Though, once we commit,
further negotiation will be impossible.
What do you have in mind?
Tax Collector's Gauntlet
When equipped, player has
the ability to cast Levy. But
each cast will destroy a random
card from player's restricted
slots. (Cannot use Levy if
restricted slots are empty.)
We use Tax Collector's Gauntlet,
combined with Risky Dice.
I understand.
We use this to steal eight cards
from them immediately...
But it's definitely dangerous.
If someone rolls Bad Luck, they'll probably die.
But this job is too important to leave to them.
We can do this!
We've come this far.
Let's clear the game.
Hey, Gen...
What are you up to?
I've told you this many times.
When taking a risk, we three share the danger.
It's Tsezgerra.
Have you reached a decision?
Okay, you have a deal.
I can do this...
One more time!
I said I can do this,
so I'm gonna do it!
Okay, let's move on to the next city!
Gon's team has begun
working to beat the game.
The story is nearing its climax.
G.I. Tutorial
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!
Today, we introduce the card Lottery.
Lottery
Change this card
into a random item card.
[SR][NORM]
When you use this card,
it changes into a random card.
That's why it's effective to use with Risky Dice.
Continue!
Next time: 15 X 15.
Hey, Killua, is this fifteen?
What did you think it was?
One five.
Cute, huh...
﻿Staff of Judgment
If player names a target,
while raising staff toward the sky,
disaster will befall either player or target,
depending on which has done more evil.
Elder's Growth Pills
Each pill taken helps player grow 1 centimeter.
Each bottle contains 100 pills.
Not recommended for those under 20.
Fledgling CEO
If you warm this fledgling egg
in your hands 3 hours a day,
it will hatch in 1 to 10 years.
The feelings you put into warming
it will speed the process.
Yes! Halfway there!
That makes fifty types!
15 x 15
Genthru and his men have a plan in mind,
as they prepare to trade
with Team Tsezgerra.
Let's get this over with, then.
Okay, trade complete.
No, hold on.
I cannot accept this.
This is an unfair trade.
What? Don't complain once it's done!
We gave you three cards!
What more do you want?
Wait a second...
That isn't what I meant.
I'm saying that it's unfair to you.
It's too skewed in our favor.
I dislike the idea of
benefiting from charity.
And it will continue to bother me,
even if we clear the game first.
So I have a proposition.
Right or left.
I'll give you one of these cards.
One is worthless,
but the other is Breath of Archangel.
Good Luck
Okay!
Levy on!
Crap!
Return on.
To Masadora!
Let's go after them!
Wait!
First, check your cards!
I lost one of the #80 cards
we were monopolizing.
As well as a #65.
Hey, what did you lose?
I lost #42 and #53.
I lost #29 and #24.
They got me good!
I lost two of the #85
cards we were hoarding.
All the ones they took were
restricted slot cards...
And they took both card types
that we were monopolizing.
Damn!
They must have used Risky Dice.
We're not with them!
They used items to change our faces!
Anyway, we have to pursue them!
No!
Hey, is Genthru the Bomber?
U-Uh, we don't know.
But he went like this with his hand and
blew the head off the guy I was with.
A power clearly meant for murder.
So he's a fighter.
It would be unwise to
fight them head-on.
But they took at least five
different card types from us!
They could have completed
their collection!
List on!
#2!
Currently, 0 players own #2, Patch of Shore.
Currently, 0 cards in play.
We're still okay.
They haven't found #2,
Patch of Shore, yet.
Our immediate priority
is to find #2 before they do!
We still have our voucher
for Breath of Archangel,
so we can still beat them.
Right, let's find it first, then.
Accompany
Warp all players within 20 meters
of caster to city (must have been visited)
or player of your choice (must have
been met inside the game).
[SR][NORM]
Accompany on!
To Soufrabi!
We did it... A big success.
The Risky Dice and Levy
combination paid off.
That puts us at ninety-three types.
No, we used one up to
change those faces,
so it's ninety-two.
The important thing is that we took
the cards they were monopolizing.
And for two of the others, we're just
waiting for someone to use Gain on them.
The biggest obstacle is #2.
But we know that it's in Soufrabi.
All right, we'll go after #72,
#21, and #9 in that order.
Then we'll make for
Soufrabi, to find #2.
For #75, we simply need to find
someone with it, then take it.
I think it's time we began thinking...
About the three restricted
slot cards we want to keep,
and how we want to spend the 50 billion.
Hey, Killua...
Something's been bugging me.
Huh?
Aren't there hundreds of players?
Isn't it weird that we've been able
to turn all our items into cards?
What do you mean?
Even B-rank restricted slot types
have a thirty-card limit.
The players here before us should
have already collected them.
That's true.
But you can also see it this way.
Fewer than thirty teams in this game
are capable of making real progress.
Oh, I see.
Most players aren't worried
about getting restricted slot cards.
They're just struggling to find
a way out of the game.
It would suck if you got to Masadora,
and there weren't any Leave cards.
Yeah, that's why...
I get it...
Huh?
If you guys got to Masadora,
but there weren't any Leave cards,
what would you do?
Well...
I'd save money until a Leave showed up.
Yeah.
Okay, then what if
you acquired a super rare
spell card while waiting?
Sell it and buy more spell
cards until a Leave came in.
Really?!
I would save it...
Wouldn't it suck if all the cards you
bought ended up being worthless?
If you saved it, you might be
able to trade for a Leaveâ€”
See?
Need a Leave?
Want to go back to the real world?
We've gotten four restricted
slot cards for three Leaves.
Okay, that makes a total
of fifty-four types.
Score!
So the cards that wouldn't fit in
our binders reverted to items.
We're running out of free pockets.
Then we should organize them now.
We three have a total
of 135 free pockets.
We should each leave
around 5 pockets free.
You keep the spell cards, Killua.
Bisky should also have
a few defensive ones.
Wait! I have to use spell cards?
No way! I don't know how they work.
The hell? Then learn how they work!
Okay...
Book.
We've been deliberately
avoiding other players,
but we'll have to take risks
to obtain the rarer cards.
Yeah.
Well, let's get what we can ourselves,
then negotiate aggressively
with any players we come across.
Sound good?
Yeah.
Yep!
See ya.
Hold on.
This is worthless.
It's a transformed Fake.
Sorry about that.
I gave you the wrong one.
Here's the real one.
Man, you can't lower your guard
around any of these guys.
No kidding...
Still, that necklace is quite useful.
Hey, this necklace can
remove curses, right?
Only from spell cards.
Oh, so it won't work.
Did you have an idea?
I was wondering if a curse
was behind the disease
that all those villagers
were suffering from.
Villagers?
Oh, those people...
The ones who took all your money.
But it won't work since
they aren't cards.
No.
It's worth a shot.
Will you trust us with your lives?
You freely gave us everything you had.
We will trust you!
Sick Villagers
Villagers struck by a
contagion passing
around the island.
Healthy Villagers
Healthy villagers who
recovered from the contagion
going around the island.
It worked!
Thank you very much!
This treasure has been
passed down for generations.
Please accept this
token of our gratitude.
Awesome!
Lucky Alexandrite
Owner will enjoy
once-in-a-lifetime experiences,
for better or for worse.
Lucky Alexandrite! Score!
Another player has used
Contact to reach you.
Yo, this is Kazsule.
I'd like to talk to you.
Could we meet in person?
About what?
Some people are close
to clearing the game.
Huh?
It's a team of three,
led by someone named Genthru.
Genthru!
Thanks for coming, everyone.
Much appreciated.
Team Kazsule
As I mentioned via Contact,
Team Asta
Team Genthru is close
to completing the game.
Team Hanse
I just checked the ranking,
Goreinu
and they're currently
at ninety-six types.
Team Yabibi
We must figure out a way to stop them.
Can I ask something?
What is it?
How do you check the ranking?
Well...
You don't know how to do that?
If we answer all their questions,
we'll be here till dawn!
Just cut to the chase.
Now, don't be so mean...
We're all here to exchange information.
They could have information
you don't, Asta.
That's impossible.
Those kids are amateurs who don't even
know how to use the Trade Shop.
In the Trade Shop,
there's a ranking that lists
players and their total
restricted slot cards.
If you pay a fee, you can even learn
the numbers of their cards.
But getting a player's name from
the ranking still won't let you
use Contact or Fluoroscopy on them.
Not until you actually meet them.
Don't you feel smarter now, boys?
In other words, if we know
the members of a team,
we can determine how
many cards they have.
And Team Genthru is only missing #0,
#2, #9, and #75.
#75...
There's a solid theory that #0 appears
in an event after the other
ninety-nine are collected,
so they only need three.
We propose to find one of those
three types before they do
and monopolize it, to prevent
them from clearing the game.
There's gotta be something else.
We could deluge them with spell cards.
They already have a Paladin's Necklace.
So Levy is the only
spell that will work.
Levy
Take 1 card at random from every
player within 20 meters of caster.
[SR][SP]
And they can block Levy if
certain conditions are met.
It's safe to assume
that Genthru is willing to reveal
that they have ninety-six types
Prison
All slotted cards on target page are
immune to theft or destruction via spell card
until removed.
(Only targets
pages 1 - 11.
Free slot pages
cannot be targeted.)
[DEF][CONT]
because their pages are
protected by Prison.
That's possible...
Genthru was collecting
a bunch of spell cards
with the others who tried to recruit us.
It's a reasonable assumption.
We could always take
their cards by force.
Would you be willing to lead the attack?
We don't know what kind
of abilities they have.
Finding a card type to monopolize
is the most practical option.
I assume no one has objections.
Then let's get to business.
We'll need everyone here to cooperate.
I'm fine with the proposed plan.
But I have a problem with these members.
Hold on, Asta.
I followed your condition...
Have over fifty types of cards.
These six teams met that condition.
I also said that they had to be
people who could contribute.
I don't see how these kids
can contribute anything.
You're the one being uncooperative.
You've got a smart mouth.
Then show me some proof
that you can be useful.
We know Team Genthru's abilities.
We have one of the three
cards they're missing.
Still dissatisfied?
No, that's good enough.
So tell us what their abilities are.
What about you?
Show us some proof you
can be useful to us.
We have seventy-one types
of restricted slot cards...
Significantly more than you.
I'll give you an A-rank card in
return for the information.
You shouldn't have a problem with that.
I have a problem.
We can obtain A-rank cards ourselves.
So give us two S-rank cards or
equally valuable information.
Otherwise, we won't tell you a thing.
Don't get too cocky, brat!
Did you hear that, everyone?
These kids won't be any help.
They want two S-rank
cards from each team.
That's ten cards they'd take.
Don't be a fool.
I'm only taking cards from your team.
Huh?
I'm fine with giving information
to the other four.
I'll let them decide
what to offer in return.
But I won't tell you anything
until you meet my condition.
You are a stupid brat...
Throwing a tantrum because
I didn't baby you, huh?
Stop this, both of you...
We don't have time to
fight amongst ourselves!
I haven't agreed to
team up with them yet!
It's fine, Asta...
Give them two cards.
We need to move on.
What?!
I have no problem with
giving them cards!
But that kid's trying to pick a fight!
You're the one picking a fight!
Hey, let's leave.
I don't want to team
up with these people!
Come, now...
Though I admit I'm a bit peeved.
But given the circumstances...
Genthru has these two abilities,
Countdown and Little Flower.
So it's best to keep
your distance from him.
Seriously? He got me...
Same here.
He touched me when we
were making a deal.
Me, too...
Sounds like a bunch of
them might be victims.
A chance!
Isn't there any way to
disable his technique?
Yep, there is...
You have to touch Genthru and say,
"I caught the Bomber."
Stupid! Why did you tell them?
We could've gotten more
cards out of them!
That would have started another fight.
The bombs can't be armed until Genthru
explains how his ability works,
so if you keep away from him,
you should be safe.
Did you know there are
two ways to cast spells?
Yep, I did.
A spell card is used up the
moment you say its name aloud.
But it's possible to
keep reusing a spell.
Huh?
For example, you know how a list
of players you've met appears if
you put Steal in your binder?
If you remove the card without
pressing the select button,
the spell card isn't used up,
so you can keep reusing it.
I never tried that.
Yeah.
You can buy all B-rank
restricted slot cards at stores.
You simply need to buy from the
same Trade Shop over fifty times.
If you become a frequent customer,
they'll start making you offers.
Do you have two Skeleton Glasses cards?
Or Emerald for Beauty and Mystery Pond?
Is that enough information
to satisfy you?
I'll give you another
card if you're not happy.
Nope, that's enough, thanks!
I'm up next, then.
I'm Goreinu.
Nice to meet you.
Thanks, everyone!
That was very educational.
The question now is which card
we should try to monopolize.
It's probably impossible to
monopolize the #75 we have.
Each team can only obtain one,
and the limit is twenty,
which is too high.
You obtained #75?
That's impressive.
List on!
#75.
Currently, 6 players own #75, Lucky Alexandrite.
Currently, 6 cards are in play.
So five other teams each have one.
Monopolizing this one
will be impossible.
What about the other two?
List on!
#9!
List on.
#2.
No good.
There are three teams with #9.
No one has #2, Patch of Shore...
We can make it work!
Guide Post On.
#2.
I know where to find it...
Soufrabi.
I've been there before!
I have an Accompany card here.
Okay, let's go.
Accompany on!
To Soufrabi!
This is Soufrabi?
It's a pretty big city...
Soufrabi
Let's head in and snoop around.
Search every room, one by one.
Some characters may not
give you information
until you visit multiple
times, so pay attention.
Okay!
Hey!
I found someone with information.
Fast!
The pirates rule this city...
There's a legend about
an underwater cavern
called the Sea God's Grotto
located somewhere in this area.
Patch of Shore is the entrance to it.
A few years ago, having heard of the
legendary cavern and its treasure,
fifteen pirates arrived in this city.
Razor and the fourteen devils...
The city fishermen were
all tortured and killed.
The pirates murdered anyone who
knew about Patch of Shore.
If you get rid of the pirates,
I'll tell you what I know.
When we visited a few months earlier,
we couldn't find a single clue.
This must be information only
available at certain times.
Maybe an event that only
occurs at this time frame?
Razor and the fourteen devils...
It's possible that the event
was triggered by the
number of players here.
Huh?
There are fifteen pirates.
And it just so happens that
there are fifteen of us.
So the event won't start until you
have a party of fifteen or more?
But how would a game
character know that?
Oh, Accompany!
Yes, a group of fifteen or more must
reach Soufrabi with Accompany.
That's probably the
trigger for this event.
Brutal...
Huh?
Oh, nothing.
Let's go to the pirate's base!
Gon and his friends stand before
some unpleasant looking pirates.
Will the fifteen allies be able
to obtain Patch of Shore?
G.I. Tutorial
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!
Today, we introduce the card
Tax Collector's Gauntlet.
Tax Collector's Gauntlet
When equipped, player has
the ability to cast Levy. But
each cast will destroy a random
card from player's restricted
slots. (Cannot use Levy if
restricted slots are empty.)
If you turn this card into
an item and equip it,
you can steal random cards from others.
And you can keep reusing it!
Clunk.
Continue!
Next time: Pirates x And x Guesses.
Go!
I can't say that!
﻿Who are you guys?
We booked this place for the night.
Get lost!
We're here to talk.
Would you please leave the city?
Been a long time since I heard those words.
Pirates x And x Guesses
Then no need for talk.
Use force to make us leave.
I don't care how many of you attack at once.
If you can move me from this ring,
I'll take you to see our boss.
We just have to move you out of the ring?
If it's brawn you want, I'm your man.
This guy's terrible.
He's taking too long just to
produce that degree of Ren.
You're pretty strong...
Stop it!
I lose... Let me go!
He admitted defeat.
Why didn't you let him go?
I explained the rules.
You lose if you step outside the ring.
Anything else, including admitting
defeat, is totally meaningless.
You kicked me, then stepped
outside the ring of fire.
You've lost.
Oh! Crap!
Hold on! Give me another try!
Don't bother, Gon...
You're probably looking to
use your new technique.
But you shouldn't reveal it in
front of all these people.
Just let me handle this.
What's this? You gonna pair up now?
I'll be using this.
You wouldn't...
There, I win.
D-Damn little brat!
You made up the rules...
Don't get upset.
Yeah, my bad...
Come with me.
I'll take you to the boss.
Eh, so your boss is in here?
Boss, we have visitors.
Who are these guys?
They want to chase us out of town.
Chase us out?
Ah...
Let's have a contest.
If you win, we'll leave the island.
However, we choose the contest.
How does that sound?
What happens if we lose?
Nothing.
You'll just have to leave.
Okay, let's do this!
The theme of this battle is sports.
Each of these members will challenge
you to a match in their best sport.
One win per person!
The first side to eight wins will be the victor.
I'm up first... I'll go with boxing.
Well? Who's up?
I've got this.
There's one special rule.
You may use any item created by Nen.
What?
You can't call that boxing!
Don't worry, I'll only use my fists.
That rule's for your benefit.
Wanna tag out?
No, I'll do it.
Fight!
I know what's going on here...
There's a reason you chose boxing!
You're also an Emitter, right?
We're fighting at close range,
within a finite space.
This is the ideal situation for an Emitter.
However, you made one mistake!
Not anticipating that my power
could be stronger than yours!
Wow! He can't dodge that flurry!
Yes, he's down! Too easy!
No, it was a simultaneous hit.
What just happened?
Why?
These guys didn't see what happened?
He used teleportation.
Teleportation?
Of only his fist, with a short uppercut.
His goal was to land a knockout counterstrike.
It was obvious.
Seems he's out cold...
That's one win for us.
Damn.
Bah.
Reaching eight wins with these
members will be impossible.
Meaning...
Okay, I'm up next...
I'll go with juggling soccer balls.
Then I'm up...
Wait, Gon.
Indeed, that would be wise.
Okay, I'm up next!
A little girl?
Now I'll have to take care not to injure you.
Injure me with juggling?
We're allowed to attack using Nen.
Provided you don't touch
the ball with your hands.
I understand.
Moving anywhere inside the building is allowed.
Whoever drops their ball first loses.
Right! Got it!
Okay, let's get started.
Ready...
Go!
What?
That was harder than I expected...
I lose.
I'm up next, then.
You wanna go, big guy?
You bet! Prepare yourself, brat!
Ready, begin!
I'll crush you!
Oh, sorry about that...
I stepped outside the ring.
Now I see... That's what they're doing.
That's eight wins.
We're the victors.
Get out.
And we can do as we please in this city.
Damn it, you brat! Come back here!
We need to fight again!
When you saw we couldn't
win with this lineup,
you decided to lose deliberately,
and gather information, huh?
But once a party has lost,
they can't make another attempt.
But it's okay if we simply
switch out one member.
It was a worthwhile risk.
You can count us out.
Huh?
We've accomplished our original objective,
keeping the Bombers from completing the game.
It will be impossible for them to
assemble a team of fifteen.
You should probably give up on this contest.
If you end up obtaining the card,
you'll just become a target.
They don't get it...
It makes sense to obtain this card quickly.
To avoid potential internal conflict.
Exactly.
Huh?
You need at least fifteen people to participate.
Even if you use Clone,
Clone
Transform into a random card
selected from the restricted slots
of one target player. (If target has
empty restricted slots or max of
selected card has been reached,
Clone is used up without transforming.
[LR][NORM]
you can only obtain three
copies of Patch of Shore.
This event was designed to incite infighting.
That's what you meant.
Brutal...
I had to think about that, since I
didn't understand right away.
Assuming that we four are capable of winning,
we still need four more up to the task.
And ideally, they'd already
be in a party of eleven.
Do you have any leads?
Book.
Looking at the names on my list,
Chrollo's probably the strongest.
But Kurapika said he's definitely a fake.
Who is it, then?
Well, it's probably a member of the Troupe.
Why would a member of the Troupe be here?
Maybe to beat the game?
But wouldn't they have used their own name?
That's true.
We can use Sight Vision.
Huh?
If this person isn't here to beat the game,
they won't bother to collect cards.
Oh, that's right.
0 cards in restricted slots
6 cards in free slots
This guy's not even trying.
His only cards are for food and water.
That makes it easier to invite them.
But if it really is a member of the
Troupe, we won't invite them.
We'll just ask a few questions.
Then there's no point in bothering.
Since it's definitely one of them.
Finding out who they are is important,
but I'd rather learn why they're here!
Are you an idiot?!
You're gonna ask them why they're here?
They aren't gonna tell you!
Yeah, I'm an idiot!
I'm an idiot, so I'm still gonna ask!
Then go right ahead!
I sure will!
Will they be okay?
This is perfectly normal for them.
I'm off, then!
Knock yourself out.
Accompany on!
Chrollo Lucilfer.
No way...
Hisoka!
Well, well...
I have unexpected visitors.
It's been a while.
As I thought.
You've matured quite a lot.
It appears that you found
an excellent teacher.
As I anticipated, you grow more
appetizing with every day.
Wh-Who is this pervy freak?
Are you their teacher?
No, it doesn't seem to be him.
Stop it!
She's the one?
So what do you want with me...
No, with Chrollo?
I have a question.
Why are you here?
Well, what to do?
If I talk, I know how they'll react.
They'll do all they can to keep the spiders from the Nen exorcist.
That would certainly be entertaining.
But I have delayed my fight
with Chrollo long enough.
I'm looking for Chrollo.
There's actually a way
to remove Kurapika's Nen from him.
You can purge it.
So you knew?
Then that makes this easier.
I'm looking for Chrollo,
to give him that information,
but I have no leads.
That's when I remembered
that some of the spiders were
interested in this game.
I thought that maybe they would
know Chrollo's whereabouts.
And by choosing this name, I ensure
that they will come to me.
I get it.
He was just pretending to
be a member of the Troupe.
Uh-huh.
Now, it is my turn for a question.
You didn't come here just
to ask that, did you?
No, I did.
Um...
Actually, we're looking for
people who are really strong.
Won't you please join us?
Hmm? Sure.
Why are you looking for strong people?
Wait, h-hold on... I'm against this.
It's too dangerous!
Yeah, you don't know who this guy is, Bisky!
Oh? That's not true.
I can sense that he's a kindred spirit.
He's lying.
We should head to the
City of Love just ahead, Aiai.
It's a great place for new meetings.
Perhaps you can find strong people there.
What did you mean about him lying?
Technically, I should say he
wasn't speaking the truth.
How could you tell?
I had a gut feeling.
A gut feeling?!
After lying for fifty years,
I can recognize a fellow liar.
That's a convincing argument.
Since he's hiding something,
we'll keep him around to see what's up.
Plus, he really is strong, right?
Uh-huh...
Hey, Hisoka!
You walk in front!
We need ten more members, correct?
Yeah...
We hope to find others like you
who aren't interested in cards.
Isn't everyone else here to beat the game?
I can't imagine there are too
many eccentrics like myself.
He's definitely hiding something.
By the way,
did you use someone's power to warp to me?
That was one of the spells in this game.
Oh, so that's what it was.
You need to buy spells from stores, right?
Something does seem fishy.
He isn't being honest.
In other words, there's something
inconsistent in his story.
He came here to find spiders who
might know Chrollo's location.
There's something off about that explanation.
City of Love, Aiai
Where are my glasses?
Why not give them to her?
You might become friends.
Hey...
Watch where you're going!
Be more careful.
S-Sorry...
I'm gonna be late!
You weren't supposed to apologize...
You should have told her to watch where
she was going and started a fight.
Stop it!
Release me! I'll scream...
Go ahead and scream.
No one's coming to save you.
Hold it!
Let go of her!
That hurt...
How could you fall for such a clichÃ©?!
You want me to model for your hairstyling?
Please allow me to cut your long, lovely hair.
Of course.
There's no point in hanging around this city.
Hisoka, let's head somewhere else.
Oh?
But we won't be bored here.
Bored...
That's it!
That's what was wrong.
This place...
This place is the problem!
If I entered this game to find someone,
what would I do?
I would see how important
the spell cards are.
Gon and Bisky ran into Hisoka
while I was outside, taking the Hunter Exam.
That means they encountered him
while they were training near Masadora.
Hisoka's been to Masadora!
Right, normally it makes no sense
for him to leave Masadora.
Because most players pass through
the city, in search of spell cards.
If he were truly looking for the Troupe,
he wouldn't have left Masadora.
But we won't be bored here.
He's bored because he has nothing to do.
So he isn't looking for anyone.
No...
He's already found them!
That must be it!
That's in line with what Bisky said.
Hisoka already met up with the Troupe,
and he's waiting for something.
What is he waiting for?
That's obvious...
The Nen purger.
The Nen purger is here, on Greed Island!
Hisoka and the Troupe know this.
I can't tell Gon yet...
He can't keep a secret.
If Hisoka realizes we know, he'll disappear.
If he leaves, we'll be down a member.
And we won't know what
the Troupe is doing.
We can't let that happen.
Hey, Killua... I've been thinking.
We should probably try to recruit Tsezgerra.
Even if he doesn't join,
we should meet with him,
so he'll be on our binder list.
It would be good to know what they're doing.
Binder? I can find out!
Hisoka, let me see your binder.
I want to see if Tsezgerra
is on the list of players you've met.
List?
That's perfect!
If I asked questions, Hisoka would be suspicious.
But Gon knows nothing,
so Hisoka won't suspect a thing.
Book.
If Hisoka refuses to show us the screen,
that'll support my theory.
There's Tsezgerra.
Really?
Yes, right here.
Huh?
He showed us? No way!
There aren't any Troupe members...
Was I being paranoid?
Is Hisoka actually still looking for them?
Then, Hisoka, recite this spell...
We'll do the talking.
Contact on.
Tsezgerra.
My Texture Surprise
really is so very useful.
Shizuku
Phinks
Franklin
Shalnark
Hisoka's ability fools Killua and his friends.
Is Hisoka a friend or foe?
G.I. Tutorial
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!
Today, we introduce the card Paladin's Necklace.
Paladin's Necklace
When a player wears this,
all spells targeting player
will be reflected.
Can also dispel curses
placed on any card
touched by player.
This card can reflect enemy spells,
and tell you if other cards are real.
Are you real?
Huh?
Continue!
Next time: A x Heated x Showdown.
I win!
One more time!
Gon, where are you going?
﻿Together, there are five of you?
Yeah, this is all of us.
There are two others in my group.
This only gives us a total of nine.
Where do you plan to find the rest?
We'll need fifteen members, right?
We can use stand-ins for the remaining six.
Invite players who want to return
to the real world but can't.
They won't be able to help,
but they won't care about
receiving cards, either.
Meaning that the nine of us will
have to win the contest.
I don't know how strong our
opponents are, but can we?
We can.
Even if we can't manage eight wins,
we're allowed to switch members and try again.
So whether we can win depends on you guys.
Show us your Ren.
We'll decide if we want you afterwards.
A x Heated x Showdown
I see our roles have been reversed.
Very well.
Here I go!
Awesome!
If I use my full strength, I can fly higher.
My record is sixteen meters,
eighty centimeters.
Ready, and...
They shattered my record with ease.
Ha ha, I win.
How much have they improved
in such a short period of time?
Darn!
I am impressed.
Although you still fall a bit
short of my full height.
Okay! Let's go again!
No way.
You won't stop until you win.
One more time... Just once more!
Oh, you passed.
Nice jump.
Sorry...
Once more!
They're only kids, so let it slide.
Fine.
We believe that you guys are strong.
But it comes down to figuring out
who to assign to which sport.
Killua, once more!
See, I knew it...
No more. I win!
Do we know all the sports they'll use?
We've managed to confirm these eight.
Beach Volleyball
Wrestling
Boxing
Juggling
Free Throws
Sumo
Bowling
Ping Pong
Depending on our success,
they may add additional sports.
I understand...
Hey, this is bad!
What is it?
Team Genthru is up to ninety-seven cards.
Then they're only missing...
Patch of Shore and Lucky Alexandrite!
Over the past week, we've run various simulations
and have prepared accordingly.
Given Team Genthru's current situation,
we can't afford to lose.
We have to win!
Yes, we'll win.
This isn't too bad...
Okay, let's go.
We'll begin with boxing.
I'll send you packing.
His special ability is teleportation.
He can teleport his uppercut.
Fight!
H-He's fast!
An infighter?
If I'm close enough, his Emitter
advantages are worthless.
He'll be so busy guarding,
he won't have a chance to use teleportation!
Nice!
The pattern depicted on the ring
is a sacred symbol that boosts Nen.
Suggesting that he can only teleport
while standing within the ring.
Essentially, he's revealing that
he isn't all that strong.
An opponent unworthy of us.
The winner is Barry!
Yes!
The winner is Rodriot!
The winner is Kess!
Yes!
That's three wins!
In terms of combat strength,
those six are very strong.
This is getting interesting...
You guys can toss your matches.
I'll take it from here.
Roger that.
Wait!
I'm done following your orders.
I'll be doing things my own way now.
Hey, brat! Let's step outside!
Outside? Do you think this is a sumo ring?
I'm done playing around.
Want me to kill you here?
Hey, Bobobo!
That's a violation of our agreement.
Want to go back to the slammer, Bobobo?
I don't give a damn!
I'm done playing this stupid game!
Anyone else with me?
If we team up, we can crush that bastard.
And then we can use a ship
to get off this island!
You'll be punished for breaking the taboo.
Didn't I warn you?
Y-Yes, you did...
Did that idiot think I wouldn't kill him?
Okay, I'll go next.
Hey, this looks bad.
We can't fight those guys...
No, hold on.
We'll be doing the fighting.
We explained how this works.
If the nine of us cannot secure eight victories,
you can just forfeit without fighting.
Really?
You guarantee we won't have to fight?
Yeah, don't worry.
That guy has a much stronger aura than the rest.
And judging by the previous conversation,
he must be a Game Master.
Can I ask something?
That guy's dead.
What about the sumo match?
Hmm? Oh, you get the win.
But we never decided who we were sending.
You're the one who said you
were going to do the sumo.
I don't care who you give the win to.
Just give it to one of the guys
standing in the back.
Okay, you get the sumo win.
Eh? Wait, me?
That gives us four wins.
Now, then...
I'll go with an eight-on-eight game
of dodgeball.
Pick the eight members you'll field.
I already have mine.
Hold on...
How is this scored?
It's one win per person, right?
Yes, one win per person.
So the victorious team receives eight wins.
Simple enough, yes?
So that was the plan?
No matter how many of his weaker members
we defeat, he can still win
the entire game alone.
Razor and the fourteen devils...
The devils are his Nen ability!
I'm against this...
If we have to field eight, you need two more!
I'm not fighting that guy!
I'm leaving now...
Once the match begins,
you can deliberately let yourself be hitâ€”
Screw that!
Didn't you see that?
If he hits us with that ball, we're dead!
Oh, just so everything is clear,
we'll be using a normal ball.
But with Nen, it's just as strong as
the Nen projectile I launched earlier.
This is crazy... I'm outta here!
Sorry, but I don't want to die yet...
H-Hold on!
We'll think of something real quick.
This is very bad.
We only have six players of any use.
So we're forced to pick two
of these spineless wimps.
We'll do this by ourselves.
If our lives are on the line,
we should only field willing players.
Do you have a problem if we only field six?
Yes, actually, I can't let you do that...
You will have to field eight members.
Otherwise, why ask you to recruit fifteen?
Saying this to an in-game character
is probably pointless,
but wasn't Bobobo one of your allies?
What did he do to deserve death?
Burglary-murder and rape-murder.
Eleven confirmed counts alone.
This is the real world.
This place, Greed Island, is located
somewhere in the real world.
This game takes place in the real world.
Revealing that information to a player who
believes they're inside a game is a taboo.
Bobobo was executed for breaking that taboo.
This guy, Razor, is a Game Master,
a real human.
Game Master?
One of the people who made this game.
Huh?
Wait, then...
Bobobo and the other pirates
are real death row criminals.
Not only did he disobey orders;
he attempted to instigate an escape.
Execution was a fair consequence.
This is the real world?
That is correct.
I never noticed.
I hadn't even considered that.
Well, it doesn't really matter.
Since this island is still isolated
from the rest of the world.
Wait a second.
If this is the real world,
does that mean that Ging is here,
on Greed Island?
Ging?
Ah...
So you must be Gon.
Yeah.
I was instructed not to go easy on you
by your old man.
I've had enough...
I don't wanna die!
Count me out! I'm gone!
H-Hey!
It's okay, let them leave.
But then we can't have a match!
I'll count as three.
You're doing the same thing,
so it shouldn't be a problem.
Yeah, that's fine.
Now it's eight-on-eight.
I'll explain the rules.
The game starts with one outside
player and seven inside.
The first team to run out of inside players loses.
Any player inside the court who's hit by
a ball thrown by an opponent is out,
and must move outside.
However,
you may bring one player inside
the court again by saying "Back."
And if the ball hits an area outside
the court, without any players,
the opposing team gets the ball.
Now, the important stuff...
The rules regarding hits
employ a cushion effect.
For example, if I throw the ball
and it hits opposing player A, ricochets,
and hits opposing player B
before hitting the floor,
both A and B are out.
But if player B in that scenario
is able to catch the ball,
player A is safe.
Exactly.
But if I throw the ball and it
hits opposing player A, ricochets,
and hits my teammate, player C,
before hitting the floor,
only player C is out.
Then if player C catches the ball,
does that mean player A is out?
Indeed.
Uh...
Do you have a question?
If an outside player hits someone
with the ball, is the hit player out?
Naturally, they're out.
But only one player
can return to the court using Back.
I am Number 0, the ref.
Let's have a clean game.
We will now begin the game.
Ready...
Go!
You can make the first move.
You sound quite confident.
Here's a little greeting, then!
You got him!
Yes! That's one down!
Good!
Let's keep this up.
There!
Okay, that's two down!
Oh, this is easy.
Okay, all ready to go...
Huh? What did you say?
I'm prepared to defeat you now.
Heh, that's funny.
Show us what you've got!
H-He stopped it with one hand?
Right, then...
Time to launch the counterattack.
He's standing so far back...
Is he going to pass it?
Fast!
Can I dodge it?
No way!
Can I catch it and live?
No!
I'll die!
Death
White Goreinu!
Nice rebound.
Goreinu's outside the court!
I see...
You have the ability to change
places with your Nen beasts.
The Nen creature was shattered...
This reflects what Goreinu imagined would
happen when he saw Razor's attack.
He immediately grasped the gap between
our opponent's strength and his own.
He won't easily rid himself of that image.
It'll be impossible for him to
recover during this match.
He's done.
Goreinu's Nen beast is the one that's out, right?
Yes, the exchange was performed
with Nen, so it broke no rules.
However, Back must be used to
bring Goreinu inside the court.
Damn... Is this how it ends?
All right, let's move on!
That pass is so fast!
I-It's too fast...
I can't follow the ball!
Tsezgerra!
Behind you!
It's heavy...
As heavy as a bowling ball.
This is gonna have insane power.
He focused his aura in his back,
and avoided a lethal blow.
Hey, patch him up.
I-I'm fine... Don't touch me.
If a player is unable to continue
playing, they're disqualified.
They won't be allowed
to play in or outside the court,
so keep that in mind.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I've really lost it...
Damn, in overall combat ability,
I should still be stronger than they are.
But when it comes to the basics like
agility and reflexes, they have me beat.
It's been a while since I've
had to work really hard.
Maybe it's time to start training from scratch.
I don't think I've done any basic
training in the past few years.
Ideally, we could knock out
everyone on the other team
without giving up the ball.
Hisoka...
Okay, give me the ball.
Oh, that's right.
If he uses his Bungee Gum, he can
retrieve the ball after it hits!
Now, do try to entertain me.
Surely this isn't everything you have.
Very well...
Okay, that's three down!
With Back, the other team still has five players!
With Bungee Gum, we can stay on the offensive.
All that's left is the order we target them.
Question for the ref.
Can the last player inside the court
use Back at the second he's hit?
That's not allowed.
For a moment, there would
be zero players in the court,
so that team would lose.
But someone outside the court may use Back
at the instant that the last player is hit.
Okay.
Hisoka...
Yes, I understand.
We leave him for last.
He throws a strong ball.
Numbers 2, 6, and 7 can't catch it.
Nice and strong!
If we're lucky, we can take out
6 and 7 at the same time!
Th-They combined?
You're strong.
Is that allowed?!
It is.
If you're allowed to combine,
are you allowed to split?
Yes, but you cannot surpass the maximum
number of players on the court.
Now!
It's my turn to attack again.
Now we have to retake the ball again.
If we're going to stop his ball...
Ken!
Their Nen is smooth and quite beautiful.
They must have trained hard.
But if Razor throws the ball at full strength,
Ken won't be enough.
They must be prepared for casualties
when they recover the ball
and try to defeat him.
Is it even possible?
So you know how to use Ken.
That means you won't die.
However...
That assumes you aren't hit in the wrong spot.
Here I come,
Gon!
Bring it!
It won't work! Run away!
You'll die!
Ko!
Gon!
Where's the ball?
Crazy...
It's drilled in there.
Gon!
Are you okay?!
I'm just fine!
The hell you are...
I used Ko to harden my arms and head,
but my legs couldn't take the impact.
However,
next time,
I'll catch it!
Gon is now fired up.
G.I. Tutorial
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!
Today, we introduce the card Accompany.
Accompany
Warp all players within 20 meters
of caster to city (must have been visited)
or player of your choice (must have
been met inside the game).
[SR][NORM]
It lets you warp everyone within 20 meters.
What if a player is 21 meters large?
Continue!
Next time: Guts x And x Courage.
Receive!
Toss!
Attack!
But we're using aura...
Because we're Hunters!
﻿Here I come,
Gon!
Bring it!
Ko!
Gon!
Are you okay?!
I'm just fine!
The hell you are...
I used Ko to harden my arms and head,
but my legs couldn't take the impact.
However,
next time,
I'll catch it!
Guts x And x Courage
An intense dodgeball match has begun.
Gon was injured by Razor's throw,
but his eyes burn with fire.
Estimating the ball's likely drop point...
Play will resume with Team Gon's
inside players controlling the ball.
But as the ceiling is considered
an extension of the floor,
Gon is out.
I'm going to use Back.
But you're...
I'm doing it!
He won't listen to us...
Fine... However!
Don't use Back until we're
down to two inside players!
Got it?
Now let's start.
Gon, get patched up.
It isn't against the rules to keep
passing the ball like this, is it?
That is okay.
All right, I'm good now.
Hey!
I'm the type that tends to hold grudges.
Time for payback, Razor!
Take this...
Black Goreinu!
So he can swap the black
one with other people?
You got me good...
That's what you get.
You're out of there!
He's out, but he's still able to return inside.
At least we can force him to use up his Back.
And the ball is in our outside territory.
Huh?
What?
Goreinu!
You have an interesting ability.
You should use it wisely.
Hold on! What was that?!
There's no rule against passing
the ball to an opponent.
And you're allowed to hit
people in the face here.
So his attack was also legal.
Had the ball touched the floor, I'd be out.
Once the user's unconscious,
the Nen beast disappears.
As I suspected, his ability works with
his direct control, not automatically.
If he regains consciousness,
the black ape may begin inside the court.
I don't anticipate that happening, though.
If the interior players are reduced
to zero before Goreinu wakes up,
the match will be decided.
It's impossible...
Even if he comes to, he won't be in any condition
to remake his Nen beast right away.
Inside the court, it's three versus three.
But we're obviously outmatched.
Half our players are gone,
and we only have one
injured kid on the outside.
Our opponents have a solid outside team,
so they can attack from anywhere.
Razor is still inside,
without needing to use Back.
And the ball rebounded to our opponents.
We're at a clear disadvantage!
Well, then...
Who is
up next?
Me?
What do I do?
It's impossible! I can't catch that!
I have to dodge!
It made a sharp turn?
Hisoka!
Bungee Gum!
That bastard...
He got us good.
He faked going for me,
when his real goal was taking out
Bisky and Hisoka in a straight line.
Actually, he could have
gambled that I'd dodge left.
Had I done that...
Bisky is out!
Move to the outside court.
What?
Didn't she dodge?
My own fault.
Huh?
This means your clothes count
as part of your body, right?
Yes.
I was certain she'd dodged it...
We're down to two!
You can't let them get the ball!
Back!
Gon has used Back.
He may move back inside.
Can we really trust a kid with this?
He's no ordinary kid...
He's the only one who's even
tried to catch Razor's throw.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Listen to me.
Do not overdo it!
Yeah.
What's one plus one?
Yeah.
This is hopeless.
Okay!
Beat him, even if it kills you!
Osu.
You okay?
Yep.
I've discovered something.
If the ball travels outside the court,
it becomes much less powerful.
Without using Ko, I only injured a couple fingers.
Then if we avoid Razor's throws,
we will avoid any significant damage.
Exactly so.
That won't be a victory.
Huh?
Don't be stupid...
If we can't win no matter what
we do, all this is pointless!
You'd better cool down, stupid.
Aren't you mad?
Huh?!
If you'd dodged left, you could've died.
Right?
I'm really pissed off...
I won't settle for some cheap win.
We have to utterly destroy him!
You must have a plan in mind...
Yeah.
I've got this.
Killua, stand over there.
Plant yourself firmly, and hold the ball.
Okay.
I get it!
First comes rock!
His aura just spiked!
Rock, paper...
Rock!
First comes rock!
His aura just spiked!
Rock, paper...
Rock!
Number 13 is out.
Catching the ball while touching the area
outside is illegal and does not count.
Play will resume with Team Gon's
outside players controlling the ball.
Wow!
He sent the biggest one flying.
Damn it...
That wasn't good enough!
He looks unhappy...
He's actually upset.
That kid's really got guts.
Not enough yet...
Not enough to defeat the real Razor!
I need more power!
Okay, let's do it again.
Give it to Razor good!
Yeah.
To beat Razor,
I'll need a lot more power.
Ren.
What?
His aura is immense.
You may have chosen the wrong sport.
He has all the time in the
world to build up his power.
You might want to dodge this one.
You must be joking.
Focus all the refined aura
into my fist.
First comes rock!
Take this, Razor!
Rock!
Paper...
Rock!
Perfect!
No way he'll catch that!
He's receiving it?
He used his own body to reduce its power.
Nice move.
That required perfect timing.
But he was able to pull it off.
This man truly is strong.
Amazing...
You can do more than just
dodge or catch the ball.
But I doubt that tip will help you.
That ball was as strong as Razor's,
but it didn't even reach the ceiling.
He managed to burn off enough
momentum with that receive.
Now the ball's directly over him!
Bungee gum.
Too bad for you.
You have to catch the ball, after all.
As dictated by the cushion effect, Razor is out.
Step to the outside.
Back.
Razor has used Back!
He remains inside.
Both teams have used Back,
and it's three-on-two!
The tables have turned!
Really?
Our team is the one on the ropes.
Hisoka probably isn't in any shape to throw.
No, he probably can't even hold
the ball with his right hand.
Gon's attacks used immense amounts of aura.
He should be starting to feel tired about now.
For him to be able to make another,
equally strong throw is unlikely.
So Killua is the only uninjured
player left on the inside?
No, you have it backwards.
He's probably sustained the most damage of all.
What do you mean?
You okay, Gon?
Yeah, but we need one more... I think.
I'll put everything into this one.
All right!
This time, end it.
One more throw...
I can take it.
Just hold out!
When Gon launched his ball,
Killua barely used any
protective Nen on his hands.
That's insane.
You saw the power of that launch...
Like a cannon opening fire!
Correct.
Essentially, he used his bare hands
to form the cannon's barrel.
Had Killua used a significant amount
of Nen to protect his hands,
his aura would have become a
barrier against Gon's punch,
reducing the power to the ball.
In order to avoid weakening the ball,
Killua used hardly any aura on his hands.
Killua's hands must be in far worse shape
than Hisoka's right hand.
Damn... I'm a fool!
How could I not be over there?
I know the technique.
And I can do it faster than Killua.
In the instant before Gon touches the ball,
you can apply a lightning-fast coat of
aura to your hands for protection!
Wait!
Time out!
Ref, I have a question.
What is it?
Can inside players choose
to move to the outside?
That doesn't violate any rules,
but you can't return inside.
Right... Come here!
Gon, if you come outside,
I can hold the ball for you.
Killua's hands must be ravaged by now.
I doubt he's in any condition
to hold the ball for you.
I know how to apply a lightning-fast coat of aura
in order to protect my hands.
I'll hold the ball, and you can
take Razor out from here.
It's our only way to win.
We can't do that.
Yeah.
Wh-Why not?
Where's the problem?
It would be a cop-out.
Huh?
This isn't the time to worry about that!
Don't overdo it, pops.
You took a pretty big hit.
I'm doing fine.
I'm not hurting as much as you think.
Then show me your hands.
I'm all right.
Look!
He can't feel anything but pain.
I can do this!
I can take one more ball.
Gon, I can do this!
It's impossible!
Gon, help me convince him.
I already knew...
I knew Killua's hands were messed up.
Tsezgerra-san,
I'm sorry, but I won't move outside.
I need Killua to hold the ball.
He's the only one who can do it!
If Bisky or Hisoka held it,
I probably couldn't use my full strength.
The only reason I can focus
wholly on hitting the ball
is because Killua's holding it for me.
So, got it now, pops?
Go get some rest.
I understand.
I'm counting on you!
Hisoka, give me the ball.
We will now resume the match.
Honestly, I'm not too good at throwing!
Now we're even.
Brilliant!
She hit him at just the right angle
so the ball would rebound to us.
Number 2 is out!
That leaves only...
Razor alone!
Gon, we need to regain
the ball from Razor first.
Of course.
One sec.
I understand. That sounds interesting.
I'm not sure it'll work, though...
Oh, but I would so love to try it.
Let's give it a shot, Killua.
Okay.
Then it's settled.
Man, you always come up
with the craziest ideas.
Counting on you, Killua.
We will resume the match now.
Gon and Killua share a strong bond of trust.
What sort of team play will emerge
when their friendship is backed
by the addition of Hisoka?
G.I. Tutorial
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!
Today, we introduce the card Contact.
Contact
Communicate with one target
player (encountered within the
game) via your Book. (Connection
maintained for a maximum
of 3 minutes. May only be
broken by player who uses card.)
[LR][NORM]
It uses your Binder to let you
contact any player you've met.
What are you doing?
Contacting aliens.
Wow, it worked!
Continue!
Next time: Bargain x And x Deal.
Let's do this, Killua!
Are you ready, Hisoka?
Yes.
Unite!
﻿We will now resume the match.
Razor's Nen beasts...
Are vanishing.
He drew the aura he'd
dispersed back into himself.
So his next throw will use his true strength.
Bargain x And x Deal
The match begins once again.
What is Gon's plan to retake the ball from Razor?
I didn't expect I'd need to use this...
It's been a long time
since I've felt this good!
He threw the ball straight up?
Does that mean...
He's going for a spike?
Hey, over there.
They're literally going to...
Combine!
I see what you're attempting.
Then it's a contest to determine
the winner!
Their plan is
for Gon to catch the ball.
For Hisoka to smother it...
And for Killua to provide support!
They did it!
They stopped it!
Way to go!
I have to applaud them for that.
They overcame my power using their wits.
And the key to their success
was that boy Killua.
Gon focused aura on his
hands to catch the ball.
The incredible concentration and focus
it took to pull that off deserve my praise.
The moment Gon caught it,
Hisoka used his power to smother the ball's
momentum so Gon wouldn't drop it.
Had his technique been less than perfect,
the ball would have flown off.
And Killua...
He was stuck between them,
acting as both a cushion and a brace,
balancing his aura between
offensive and defensive.
If the aura around his body had been too weak,
he would have failed to work as a cushion,
and all three of them would have taken
major damage from the ball's impact.
But if he hadn't used enough aura on his legs,
he would have failed to act as a
brace, and the ball would have
knocked all three of them outside the court.
He needed to analyze how to balance
his aura between body and legs
within one-percent accuracy.
A feat that demanded both experience and talent.
But Killua managed to compensate for
his inexperience with his prodigious talent,
allowing him to overcome such a difficult task.
His talent is scary.
I didn't reach that point until
I was in my late twenties...
I have to beat them before they can combine.
Right after their attack, my chance will come.
If I can get them at that moment,
they won't have time to combine.
Certainly, Gon's throw is powerful,
but now I have the power to catch
it without being pushed back.
Then I can pick them off one at a time.
I need more power...
More...
More!
He didn't use his full strength earlier?
Unbelievable...
He's a monster.
Ging, you should be happy.
This kid is definitely your son.
Killua, I'm going all-out.
You'd better!
If you don't, I'll smack you!
First comes rock!
Rock,
paper...
Rock!
More powerful than anticipated.
But I can catch it!
However, the momentum
will force me out of bounds!
So catching isn't an option,
but I can't dodge, either!
Come...
Trying to receive it again?
Fool, that'll let Hisoka grab it!
I wouldn't be so sure...
That depends on
the direction in which I direct it!
He bounced it back!
Gon, dodge!
You'll still win!
No, he won't dodge.
That isn't how he wants to win.
During this match, I've learned
that much about him.
He's unconscious?
Oh, right.
It was the aura he expended...
He truly used every ounce of strength.
You can take pride in this.
You've won, Gon.
Not quite yet.
Why would you do that?!
He desired total victory.
Right, Gon?
He bounced it back again!
Interesting.
Are we just rallying now?
It'll come down to stamina!
The ball is stuck...
Bungee Gum possesses the properties
of both rubber and gum.
Razor, catching the ball while touching the
area out of bounds is against the rules.
You're out!
Which makes Team Gon
the winner of this match!
All right!
That was amazing, guys!
Huh?
What happened at the end?
They beat me good...
Oh, so Hisoka finished the job.
In the end, he stole all the glory.
It was only possible with all of your help.
Call this a victory for the team.
That doesn't sound like you at all.
You beat me.
As promised, we'll leave the city.
Oh, yeah...
That was this game's purpose.
But first,
I will answer your question about Ging.
Ow!
Honestly, you were so reckless!
Your hands are a total mess.
Hey, are you listening?
The answer is that Ging isn't here.
Nor do I know where he is.
Oh...
Well, I was expecting that.
But I can tell you some stories that I know.
Yes, please!
I, too, was a death row convict.
I was a murderer.
I'd been arrested, jailed, and sentenced to die,
when Ging hired me to come here.
Ging taught me it took only one person,
one person in the entire world who will trust you,
to save you.
My son will come here one day.
When that happens, give him a good beating.
Does that mean I'm allowed to kill him?
Don't get too cocky.
He is my son.
Then, I'm counting on you, Razor.
I always thought your old man was insane.
He'd spend hours with a death
row convict going on and on
about a game he made, like a kid would.
And then he hired that convict
to fight his own son.
Scum! Who do you think is letting you live?
Hey...
You!
Over there!
Oh, that...
Then, I'm counting on you, Razor.
It felt like no one had ever
called me by name before.
Ging believed in your strength,
so he left you to me.
And I believed in your strength,
which is why I didn't hold back.
Yeah, but I couldn't have won
without everyone else.
That was some good teamwork.
Yeah.
Gon, go find Ging.
Yep!
This is the place.
A window?
We can see the shore from here.
How do we reach the Sea God's Grotto from here?
Directly below the point on the
surface the light points to.
There's a grotto down there.
But there isn't any treasure there.
I'm sorry I deceived you.
Really?
It's a sacred cavern,
so only a few fishermen know the location.
All other stories you heard were
rumors made up by others.
Including the stories of treasure.
But Razor and his gang wouldn't believe us.
Those who make their living on
the sea can never defile it.
So they said before they were all killed,
taking the secret with them.
Hey...
You get that this is a story in a game, right?
I can finally see the ocean again from here.
The sunrise...
The boats returning with their hauls...
The water sparkling in many colors.
In my mind, this view is the true treasure.
Patch of Shore
The entrance to an
underwater cavern known
as the Sea God's Grotto.
The cavern changes
every time you enter.
Yes! We got Patch of Shore!
Let's use Clone to make two copies.
We're fine with taking the copies.
Yes, you've earned the right to the original.
Hisoka, you really don't want anything?
No, it was quite fun.
Why don't you join us?
I'm curious about the Troupe's actions.
I'm not interested in collecting cards.
Should anything else come up,
use Contact to reach me.
I'll use Accompany or Magnetic
Force to come at once.
Huh?
That liar!
Huh?
We haven't used Magnetic Force
at all since Hisoka joined, right?
That means he already knew about
spell cards before he ran into us!
Killua,
there are liars who only lie
when there's a reason to,
and there are liars who also lie without reason.
You and I are the former.
He is the latter.
You won't get anywhere by fretting over it.
Another player has used Contact to reach you.
It's been a while.
Do you know who this is?
Genthru?
What do you want?
First, I'd like to congratulate you.
What are you talking about?
Don't bother playing dumb.
I promise to spare your lives.
In return, hand over Patch of Shore.
Don't be ridiculous.
Well, I am somewhat interested
to see if you can beat us.
If you're willing to deal,
come alone to Masadora's entrance in one hour.
If you don't, we'll take the card by force.
You cannot escape us.
We have many copies of Accompany.
How?
I knew he'd find out, but not this soon!
Asta, Amana, Manheim,
Nick Cue, Souheil, Kazsule...
They were all members of
your party of fifteen.
Isn't that right?
Check your Binder.
They're no longer with us.
Book!
This means they're either dead
or no longer in the game...
Genthru!
Who are you?
Gon Freecss!
I'll take you on!
Gon?
So you're one of those three kids.
It appears you have Lucky Alexandrite.
Once I'm done with Tsezgerra, I'll come for you.
Or do you want to give up the card now?
You come here this instant!
I'll fight you!
I also have—
Tsezgerra, can you move somewhere else?
Another player has used Contact to reach you.
This is Phinks.
We found him.
I'm heading your way.
Wouldn't it be faster to target the kids?
They probably have a copy of Patch of Shore.
But it would be a card created by Clone.
That's true.
Once those kids see Tsezgerra
surrender, they'll give up.
If we go after the kids first,
Tsezgerra will have time to recover,
and that will just give us more trouble.
He is a Single Star Hunter.
And we don't know what his power is.
Genthru doesn't know your strength.
So he believes that we are carrying
the original Patch of Shore.
They want the original card...
they want "our" card.
We'll try to buy as much time as possible.
Use the time to regain your strength.
If you want to beat this game, you'll
have no choice but to fight them.
And you are the only ones
with a chance to win.
But, Gon...
Just now, your actions were
both selfish and foolish.
If they'd accepted your challenge and come,
what would have happened
to Killua, given his injuries?
You endangered not only yourself,
but your friends too, by losing
control of your emotions!
I'm sorry.
Very well.
It will all come down to Accompany.
If we evade their use of Accompany,
we should be able to buy plenty of time.
But if too much time passes,
they may decide to switch and target you.
I estimate we have a one-week limit.
Past that, we can't make guarantees.
One week...
That isn't long.
And that's probably optimistic.
They may well switch to us after three days.
I'll go with Tsezgerra.
What about you guys?
If we're buying you time,
that implies we have an alliance.
No, wait.
There is little benefit from an alliance with them.
The enemy already knows the
eight of us have teamed up.
So we won't be able to act as decoys
while you take out Genthru.
That means leaving the original versions
of the last two cards they seek,
#2 and #75, with any one
party would be dangerous.
So my offer to buy time isn't an alliance.
I'm offering a deal.
A deal?
Three weeks...
That's the amount of time we can buy.
If we succeed, will you give
us #75, Lucky Alexandrite?
That doesn't make sense.
You just said one week was the limit.
That's assuming we stay on the run.
If necessary, I can force a stalemate of sorts.
I see.
But for #75, we could just
tell you how to obtain it.
No, we already know how.
But Goreinu and the rest of us
have few empty slots left.
It's no longer reasonable to turn
all our cards over to the villagers.
Three weeks.
That isn't enough time for
Killua's hands to heal.
And it certainly isn't enough to close the
gap between Genthru's abilities and ours.
Which means we should use the
time to come up with a plan.
Exactly.
Devise a scenario in which
you can defeat Genthru.
Identify the required circumstances,
and prepare to carry out that plan.
Got it.
Good...
We'll leave to delay Team Genthru now.
Keep this in mind, Gon...
They've already killed over
fifty players in this game.
If you want to beat the game,
you'll have to fight them.
Accompany on!
To Masadora!
Three weeks... That isn't much time.
Killua, you focus on healing
and thinking of a plan to defeat Genthru.
Right.
Gon, you train with me.
The first necessity is that you be
able to avoid his Little Flower.
Osu!
Gon has won his match against Razor.
But the bombers remain stronger
fighters than Gon's group.
Will they be able to devise a viable plan?
G.I. Tutorial
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!
Today, we introduce the card Clone.
Clone
Transform into a random card
selected from the restricted slots
of one target player. (If target has
empty restricted slots or max of
selected card has been reached,
Clone is used up without transforming.
[LR][NORM]
It transforms into one
random card from the player's restricted slots.
Gold Dust Girl
A girl who releases golden dust.
One bath a day will net 500G.
Very shy and quiet.
Wow, Gold Dust Girl!
Gain!
Continue!
Next time: Chase x And x Chance.
Battera!
Sabazushi!
Battera.
Barazushi.
Zushi, Zushi, osu!
﻿Where is our friend?
Machi and Nobunaga are tailing him.
He's just up ahead.
We'll let you negotiate with the exorcist.
We're willing to pay any price he asks.
Anyway, just make sure he agrees to do it.
I understand.
After all, I won't get to fight Chrollo otherwise...
Chase x And x Chance
That's him.
How did you find him?
Hell if I'll tell you, fool.
You in the shadows,
was it through your power?
You didn't even use En.
Are you some kind of freak?
I recently completed a very entertaining battle.
I'm quite sensitive at the moment...
To calm myself down,
I rather feel like messing up
a complete stranger.
Damn.
Come on out.
Was my Zetsu not good enough?
No, it was perfect.
This guy is just insanely perceptive.
Here is Troupe member #4.
In other words, your replacement.
My name is Kalluto.
I cannot tell you how my power works,
but we found him by using it.
Ah...
You look very appetizing as well.
Be careful.
He certainly isn't picky.
Hisoka, you'd better succeed.
You people are so tedious.
I certainly shall, for my own benefit.
Are you serious about fighting the boss?
Of course I am.
Would you prefer that I survive,
or that Chrollo survives?
A stupid question.
Once you finish your job here,
you can die, for all I care.
And if I kill Chrollo, then what?
That would be impossible.
But I'll answer your question.
I would pursue you to the ends
of the Earth to kill you.
I like the sound of that...
Our objective is
to obtain Breath of Archangel,
currently monopolized by Team Genthru.
We must force them to transform a card,
or we won't have a chance to use our Voucher.
And that's where Team Gon comes in.
While they may not have the
strength to win outright,
they are highly likely to deal serious
damage to a member of Team Genthru.
If they're forced to use a Breath of Archangel,
Voucher
A voucher that can be
exchanged for Breath
of Archangel. Can only
be obtained when
Breath of Archangel
has attained its card
transformation limit.
our Voucher will become a Breath of Archangel.
Breath of Archangel
An angel that cures any
mortal injury or terminal
illness with one breath.
But angel only appears once.
After that...
We only need Lucky Alexandrite!
And if we can buy three weeks for those kids,
they'll trade the card to us!
Yes.
Right, it's time.
Let's get going.
Cards Needed
Patch of Shore
Lucky Alexandrite
I believe I told you to come alone.
We weren't able to make a decision,
Cards Needed
Breath of Archangel
Lucky Alexandrite
Blue Planet
so we kept discussing it on our way here.
And we've finally reached a consensus.
We choose to fight!
Levy on!
Accompany on!
To Antokiba!
Book.
Check your cards.
Book!
It's okay.
They only stole some useless
cards from my free slots.
Same here.
I didn't lose anything important.
Guess that settles it.
We take their cards and kill them.
They'll put up a fight.
Huh?
I don't know what's happened to them...
But their resolve was written all over their faces.
Six copies of Accompany,
twenty-four of Return,
nine copies of Castle Gate,
and two of Magnetic Force.
I spent all our money on them.
Okay, then we'll meet up in three days.
Use that time to earn money
and buy the cards we need.
Got it.
Do you think they'll come after us?
Not immediately.
We now have nearly twice the number
of Accompany cards as Genthru.
If they use Clairvoyant Serpent, they'll see that.
Just you watch, Genthru...
This is how a Single Star Hunter fights.
A Few Days Later
Gyo!
Too slow!
Don't stop to think after I grab your arm.
Act the second you feel my touch!
Osu!
Too slow.
Osu!
You're still too slow!
Osu!
Okay, let's take a ten-minute break.
Next, we'll start Emitter training.
Osu.
He's building his stamina...
But in the mere two weeks we have left,
I can only help him bolster his defense.
We need another weapon before we can fight.
Emitter training, level two.
Elevation!
You must maintain this stance,
while staying perfectly still,
and only by releasing aura.
If you can elevate around
at least that high, you pass.
Okay!
That training is a lot harder,
given that it's only a level higher.
Naturally... Because this is
really level-five training.
Five?
Are you sure you should skip levels like that?
Well, it's a gamble.
If it doesn't work, we'll have wasted
the three weeks we were given.
If we followed the proper sequence,
he could reach level three easily.
But that wouldn't do him any
good in actual combat.
He needs an Emitter attack that
can push an opponent back
several meters with a direct hit.
It must be that strong for
him to use it as a weapon.
So you jumped to level five...
But even if he clears the training,
the ability to send enemies flying
isn't a desicively lethal weapon.
Exactly right.
It's only meant to give him more options.
So have you made any progress on a plan?
First, can you tell me what your power is?
My job will be easier with that information.
I'll introduce you to my power.
Magical Esthetician Cookie-chan.
She specializes in providing
massages of pure pleasure.
She'll burn off excess fat and guide both
your body and your soul to paradise.
When her aura, transformed into
special lotion, is applied to the skin,
it makes your skin look younger.
She can also use acupressure massage
to cleanse your body internally.
Constipation, stiff shoulders, chills...
any anomaly you have will vanish!
That's it?
Of course not!
She can also do chiropractic massages,
meditative massages, rolling massages...
And there's still much more!
Are you an idiot?!
That's totally worthless!
What are you talking about?!
That's the most useful power in the world!
This is why you're just a stupid old hag!
I dare you to say that again!
Return on!
To Soufrabi!
Wait up!
Was it them again?
Damn, they're getting pretty blatant...
They're definitely targeting us!
That isn't the issue.
How do they know where to find us?
If they were using Accompany or Magnetic
Force to move straight to us, we'd know,
but that isn't the case.
They're using hit and run tactics,
then making clean escapes.
We immediately move to a different location,
but before long, they find us.
They're using Nen.
If they aren't using a spell,
like homing or tracking,
one of their members must have
a Nen power similar to radar.
We can't defend against that!
What do we do?
We'll just have to use some force.
That's one copy of Accompany...
Take all his C-rank cards.
Okay, we'll set Steal on his binder...
He hasn't met them before.
Then he's clean.
Hey, have you heard of the bombers?
Yes, I've heard the rumors...
We are the bombers.
I just set a bomb on you.
I can kill you from anywhere, anytime I wish.
If you don't want to die,
bring me the cards I request.
Hey, here's another Accompany!
I'll set Steal in here....
Kess
Tsezgerra
Rodriot
Uh-oh!
Too bad!
You're out!
Crap...
What are those bastards thinking?!
They're camping outside the spell card store.
And they're attacking every player who
walks out with newly bought cards.
Contact
Communicate with one target
player (encountered within the
game) via your Book. (Connection
maintained for a maximum
of 3 minutes. May only be
broken by player who uses card.)
[LR][NORM]
This is pure speculation.
But they must be aware of me.
They've realized that someone new is
providing cards to Team Tsezgerra.
So to flush me out,
they check the binders of
anyone who exits the store,
disposing of everyone who's met one of you.
They also steal their cards.
They're primarily focused on obtaining
Accompany and Magnetic Force.
And any players that they free
once cleared of suspicion
are forced to collect cards for them.
By eliminating suspects and taking their cards,
they also cut off our supply.
They're killing three birds with one stone.
Got it.
We'll try to track their movements.
Get away from there and
wait for us to contact you.
Silent Worker: Fly on the Job
They don't appear to be leaving Masadora.
Okay, next we check their cards.
Together, those three have
sixteen copies of Accompany
and two of Magnetic Force.
That's a significant increase...
At this pace, they'll catch up
to us in four to five days.
But we expected that.
They're saying they won't move
until they have enough cards.
Everything is going well.
Twelve days left.
It's not working...
Listen to me.
While training, see yourself firing a water pistol.
You build up aura within your body,
then shoot it from your palm!
The greater your power,
the stronger the aura you fire.
You want to release all the aura
you've kept closed up inside.
The total amount of refined
aura you apply to the attack,
and the speed, power, and timing
you apply to the release...
You need all of those elements
to land the attack you'll require.
It's too hard!
I just don't get how you push the aura
in your body out of your hand...
He hasn't made any progress for ten days.
Maybe you should have let
him start from level two.
We still have ten more days...
Only if Tsezgerra can deliver.
In hindsight, it wasn't a very good deal.
If we give Team Tsezgerra Lucky Alexandrite,
they'll only be missing two cards.
We still need over thirty...
We can just take them from Genthru by force.
Gon would never accept that...
And we still have to figure out
how to defeat Genthru first.
That's true.
So is this big enough?
Yeah.
A Few Days Later
We now have forty-eight copies of Accompany.
If you total their Accompany, Return,
and Magnetic Force cards,
they only have forty-five cards.
Now they can't evade us.
Let us start a game of tag we cannot lose.
Accompany on!
Tsezgerra!
They're on the move!
They're coming our way at an incredible speed!
We move according to the plan!
Accompany on!
To Masadora!
Accompany on!
Tsezgerra!
Accompany on!
To Soufrabi!
Accompany on!
Tsezgerra!
Accompany on!
To Masadora!
Accompany on!
Tsezgerra!
I'm out now.
Barry!
Roger that.
Accompany on!
To Soufrabi!
Damn, we only have five days left...
Don't you have any advice that
could help him break through?
The sensation of aura flowing through the body
is different for everyone.
If I give him advice from my own perception
and he makes incorrect assumptions,
it could end up hurting more than helping.
How many do we have left?
Seven copies of Accompany.
They aren't coming...
Did they give up?
No way.
They're taking their time to throw us off.
If we run out of Accompany,
we'll have to use Return.
Understood.
We'll alternate between Aiai and Soufrabi.
How's it going over there?
Let's find out.
Contact on.
Goreinu.
This is Tsezgerra.
How's it going there?
You were right.
Sub and Bara have appeared.
Most likely the real ones.
They're speculating that I'll try to buy
cards while they're playing tag.
Which means it's Genthru and a couple
of fakes that are chasing you.
Then Tsezgerra's predictions were accurate!
The same trick won't work again.
Right now, Genthru is alone,
while there are four of us.
This is our chance!
No, I would prefer better odds for a fight.
We'll stick to the original plan.
Here they come.
We're back on the run!
Gon...
Time's up.
Your training's over.
We still have five days!
Change in plans.
I came up with a plan for defeating them.
But... But...
Uh, well...
I think I've almost got it.
Maybe...
No, it isn't happening.
And I can't use an unreliable
technique in my plan...
Give up.
So the plan is...
To use this.
Huh?
You'll have to learn this the hard way.
Until you get it down to perfection.
We're out of Accompany cards...
Use Return!
Return on!
To Aiai!
They're out of Accompany cards?
We're finally getting close.
Sub, Bara...
How's it going? Catch anyone?
Only one, and it was someone new to the game.
Word's out that the bombers are hunting
players around here, so everyone's staying away.
Could he have been someone
we already disposed of?
Perhaps...
Okay, come back.
I'm in Soufrabi now.
They're out of bullets.
Leave
Send one target player
off the island.
[SR][NORM]
We're finally down to our last card.
If they follow us outside the game,
we can fend them off at the mansion.
If they don't follow us, we just have
to wait until the time limit is up.
It's perfect...
All that's left is choosing the
three to keep for winning.
We just have to ask Mr. Battera what he wants.
Okay, let's go!
Leave!
No one's here.
What's going on?
Weren't armed guards standing by?
Sabazushi, where are you?
Answer if you're there!
Sabazushi!
Keep it down...
I was taking a nap.
A nap?
What happened to everyone else?
They left.
Mr. Battera canceled the whole thing.
We received an intermediary fee
and a cancellation fee.
But I stayed behind because I
thought I should inform you.
Canceled?
Mr. Battera!
What is the meaning of this?!
We're so close!
We're close to beating the game!
It doesn't matter...
Doesn't matter anymore.
Doesn't matter?!
That's crap!
What about all the time and effort we've spent?
My lawyers have been instructed to pay you.
You can do whatever you want with the cards.
So now,
just leave me alone...
Damn!
What's going on?
I don't know.
Why did this happen?
We're free to kill them out here.
Since their ring data won't disappear.
Team Tsezgerra has given Gon and his
friends the time that they promised.
But awaiting them was a
situation they didn't expect.
G.I. Tutorial
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!
Today, we introduce the card Fake.
Fake
Change Fake into any card type from 001 to 099.
The new card can be placed in a restricted pocket.
But it will not count toward Book completion,
and cannot be transformed into an item.
It also will not count toward card limit.
[SR][NORM]
It can transform into any card from 001 to 099.
But it doesn't count toward binder completion.
And it can't be transformed into an item.
Funny face!
Continue?
Next time: Insanity x And x Sanity.
Hey, Gon,
want to see my special attack?
I sure do!
You'll have to wait till next week!
Are you insane?
﻿Tsezgerra
Rodriot
Barry
Kess
Today is the tenth day.
If they don't return, their data will be erased.
Well, I guess we have to wait
for Goreinu to contact us.
Yes! I got it!
Look, I've got this down pat.
Can I concentrate on Emitter training now?
No!
You might have it down, but you're
still off by a tenth of a second.
Your goal is to be within a hundredth of a second.
Now start!
Man...
Another player has used Contact to reach you.
Insanity x And x Sanity
It's Goreinu.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
What's going on?
Do you realize it'll soon have been 240 hours
since Tsezgerra's team exited the game?
Yeah.
I can tell you now they won't be returning.
Why not?
Genthru's team is camping the starting point.
We decided beforehand that they
wouldn't return to the game
until I sent an all clear signal.
I understand.
But their card data will disappear.
I'm holding on to all the valuable cards.
Doesn't that betray that they have other allies?
They'll notice if none of the four
have any important cards!
They left the game at 3:05, ten days ago, right?
Yeah, in five more minutes,
their card data will be wiped.
Essentially, they'll be out of it.
To be safe, we'll wait until 3:10.
But do you really think they've given up?
Absolutely.
Given that they took Battera and ran.
It was a desperate attempt to
keep us from the reward.
But they spent years collecting
those ninety-six cards.
Also, I'm wondering why Battera
would send his guards packing.
No idea... Guess something happened.
No point in speculating about it now.
Oh, it's 3:10.
Time's up.
Yay!
Bye-bye, Tsezgerra!
Fake?
Yeah,
we switched about thirty of their
ninety-six cards with fakes.
I'm the one actually holding
the ninety-six cards.
For such a cautious man, this is the
biggest gamble of Tsezgerra's life.
So I want to make sure it pays off.
I'm sorry, but I won't be able to
help you face Genthru's crew.
Understood.
When do you want us to give you the card?
I'll wait until you've defeated Genthru.
Good luck.
Accompany
Warp all players within
20 meters of caster to city
(must have been visited)
or player of your choice
(must have been met
inside the game).
[SR][NORM]
Now it's time to go after those kids.
It wasn't in the plan, but we can
get Patch of Shore from them.
First, we need more copies of Accompany.
Okay.
They're on the move.
Where are you right now?
Near Soufrabi.
They're heading toward Masadora.
Once they're prepared, they'll come for you.
Are you ready?
Absolutely.
We have you guys to thank.
We need more time.
But we have no choice. It'll depend on Gon.
Gon!
Did you let our conversation
distract you and lose track?
Please explain what this is about.
I realize that I was being intrusive,
but I took a look.
Your daughter?
Or perhaps your granddaughter?
My lover.
She'd been hospitalized for a long time.
She was in a coma.
A few days ago,
she passed away in her sleep.
I suppose she didn't want people
thinking she wanted my money,
because she returned every gift I gave her.
But she loved
this shoddy picture frame that I made myself.
All we ever needed was one other.
We swore that we would never be apart...
Until the accident
that put her into a sleep from
which she'd never wake...
Indeed...
She appeared to only be sleeping...
That was when I heard about Greed Island.
Breath of Archangel
An angel that cures any
mortal injury or terminal
illness with one breath.
But angel only appears once.
If I beat that game, I could obtain the one thing
that I need most, like a dream come true.
I was prepared to spend my
fortune on copies of that game.
But it doesn't matter any longer...
It doesn't matter...
The kids have four copies of
Accompany among them.
We have six.
Shall we go, then?
Yeah.
Whenever you're ready.
I'll take the kid with spiky black hair.
Assuming we need to resort to force.
Sub, take the slant-eyed kid.
Bara, you take the girl.
Accompany on!
Gon!
What do you want?
Don't be so hostile.
We're here to propose a deal.
A deal?
We aren't interested!
Right, don't let them notice
that we've been waiting for them,
completely prepared.
It's not a bad deal.
We have a good idea that Tsezgerra approved.
What is it?
Interested now?
Stop! Talk from where you are!
Yes, that's good.
We must act like we're at a
significant disadvantage.
We have to convince them
that we're being forced into this position.
It's quite simple.
We'll beat the game on everyone's behalf,
then everyone returns to the real world.
And we'll split Battera's reward.
I find that hard to believe.
We've had a change of heart.
And Tsezgerra has already left the game.
But that doesn't prove that
he agreed to your offer.
You have a valid point.
Then, what now?
Do you want to die?
Stop whining, and hand over your cards!
Otherwise, we'll slaughter you!
You've revealed your true colors.
Book!
Accompany on!
To Soufrabi!
Three more times.
Two more times.
One more time...
Return
Warp to a city
of your choice.
(Must be a city
you have visited.)
[LR][NORM]
Return on!
To Masadora!
Masadora?
Are they trying to obtain more spell cards?
They might try to escape to the
real world through the port.
Accompany on.
Gon!
They're not here.
Are they hiding and concealing their presences?
Check at the store.
We don't want to let them buy any spell cards.
They haven't been here.
Did they head for the port?
Tsk, guess we have no choice.
Accompany on!
Gon!
Don't lose sight of them!
We're out of Accompany cards!
Now why don't you give up,
and hand over your cards?
No way!
We'll never let you have them!
Everything's gone to plan.
They mean to fight us one-on-one.
If we have to hand over our
cards, we'd rather fight!
Wait, Gon!
Damn...
Good.
Now we only need to separate them.
Bisky, you run for it!
B-But...
Just run!
Wait!
Hey, you aren't getting away.
I'm counting on you guys.
You're up against me!
You know that I'm the Bomber?
I heard it from Tsezgerra.
And who told you how my power works?
Incredible.
That moment was enough for him to know
what I'm watching out for and why...
This is the difference in experience between us!
There aren't too many people
who know about my power
and are still alive.
Book!
I can't let him control things.
I don't like people just taking
cards from other players!
So let's make a deal.
Whoever surrenders first has
to give up all his cards.
You seem to have the wrong idea.
You're in no position to make demands.
This is your last chance to make a deal.
Otherwise, you're nothing more than a thief.
I'd rather die than hand
over my cards to a thief!
You can kill me, but I still
won't take out my binder!
You're insane.
And I don't mean my kind of insane.
Very well.
You have a deal.
Book.
I'm holding one hundred thirty-one cards.
I have ninety-seven of the restricted slot cards.
I have one hundred and two cards.
And seventy-one of the restricted slot cards.
Book.
You have #2 and #75, correct?
Yeah.
Book.
That's all I need.
An excellent show of Ren...
But clearly, he has much
room for improvement.
Offense is the strongest defense.
You're strong enough that
a single explosion won't be
enough to finish you off.
So stay on the attack!
This kid has skill.
But his use of aura is sloppy at best.
Not sure why he was so confident.
At this point, you're nowhere near his level.
You won't be able to deal significant damage.
But continue to attack!
Because he will still defeat you.
You still haven't answered my question.
Who told you about my power?
Well, it isn't important now.
My point is
that I don't need my ability to deal with you.
All according to plan.
Once he's seen how much stronger he is,
we'll begin to lure him into our trap!
Osu!
That's how I'd like to respond...
But I don't like the idea of
being totally manhandled.
I'll make him use his power...
I'll carry out the plan afterwards!
Looks like you need a little more pain!
Use your power.
I have a surprise for you!
I see what you're thinking.
I won't use it!
Damned kid!
She's faster than I expected.
Book!
She should be out of teleportation spells.
What's she doing?
She used Transform to hide
it as a different card?
Accompany on!
To Soufrabi!
Accompany?
Why?
I don't get it...
Why would you go to all this
trouble to be alone with me?
One reason...
Because I didn't want to let you cry for help.
Huh?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
You're such a fool...
I'm telling you that I'm stronger.
Damned brat!
Your attacks are too weak...
You can't defeat me!
I won't hold back...
So don't blame me.
That's what I was going to say.
I was being nice, so I let you hit me once.
Because I can't restrain myself when I revert.
And I end up killing my opponents!
Oh, you're alive?
I'm impressed.
Why would you...
hide your power?
Two reasons...
The ace up your sleeve should remain hidden...
And more than anything, I hate the way I look.
Too macho!
Don't you agree?
He can't hear me anymore?
I have a slight advantage in martial
skill and physical strength.
But he has me beat in aura capacity.
I probably won't be able to hurt
him with any normal attack.
Which makes him perfect to experiment on.
Damn...
I felt that hit inside my head.
I can't afford to fool around.
Wrong.
Experiment #1...
Lightning Palm!
Lightning Palm
Doesn't seem to be enough to knock him out.
But I can immobilize him for a few seconds.
Okay.
Experiment #2...
A yo-yo?
Let's do this.
What's he up to?
What's that thing made of?
This is a superalloy yo-yo my brother ordered.
It weighs around fifty kilograms,
so it packs quite a punch!
Whoa!
Damn...
Between the weight and centrifugal
force, that really hurts.
He always leaves his right side exposed
when I attack a certain way!
If I take his yo-yo, leaving him empty-handed,
he'll make the same mistake!
My chance!
There!
Yes!
Time to crush you!
Oh?
Did I forget to mention that I have two yo-yos?
Wow, you're still conscious?
Did you know that
when you kick me, you raise your
guarding arm on the other side?
You're creating your own blind spot.
He used my blind spot to pull
out a yo-yo and attack?
Then your defensive habit...
Was a fake to make you
kick me with your left leg.
And when you released your first yo-yo...
I knew you picked up something to throw at me.
Why did you use Accompany to
draw me away from the others?
To make you focus on a one-on-one chance,
so you'd lose track of your surroundings.
I don't believe it..
You set three traps during that brief exchange?
Three?
You must be joking...
Every move I made was a trap.
Experiment complete!
Both work.
Why won't you accept your fate?
You can't beat me.
No way.
I...
I haven't lost yet!
I was mistaken.
I take back what I said.
You are strong...
I will show you my power.
This battle is mental, not physical.
I must crush his will.
His will to fight, his will to stand,
his will to resist.
Otherwise, he'll never admit defeat...
To win, I must swallow my
pride and play it smart.
Let me demonstrate that all your hard
work and confidence mean nothing!
Here he comes.
The devilish man has unleashed his true power.
Can Gon emerge victorious?
G.I. Tutorial
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!
Today, we introduce the card Breath of Archangel.
Breath of Archangel
An angel that cures any
mortal injury or terminal
illness with one breath.
But angel only appears once.
A card that can cure injury and disease.
Mito-san used this all the time.
Huh?
Boo-boos, begone!
Continue!
Next time: Victor x And x Loser.
Ow! That hurts...
What's wrong, Killua?
My tooth hurts...
Good kids always brush their teeth.
﻿I must crush his will.
His will to fight, his will to stand,
his will to resist...
Let me demonstrate that all your hard
work and confidence mean nothing!
Victor x And x Loser
He's fast...
I had no time to dodge!
But I can still block his attacks!
Oh? He used Gyo?
The moment I grasped his arm,
he focused his aura there to block my attack.
Idiot!
You think you've outwitted me now?!
What's the matter?
That was just a body blow.
If you focus your aura where I grab you,
you leave yourself open everywhere else.
It's futile...
In fact, you're only making
it harder on yourself.
Bisky was right!
You won't be smiling much longer!
One more hit to send you to hell!
Impossible!
That was the hardest hit so far!
He shouldn't have been able to counter.
But since he did, that means he
kept the damage to a minimum.
In other words, he blocked me
without relying on aura.
He guessed I didn't intend to set off a bomb?
No, that wasn't a guess.
Hey, Bisky...
How does Genthru avoid being
burned by his own bombs?
That's quite simple.
He shrouds his hand in aura that's
stronger than the explosion.
Oh... I get it.
It's a technique that requires
a large aura reserve.
This is a good opportunity.
By now, you should be able to tell.
Excellent reaction!
You've almost perfected Gyo.
One more time, then.
Huh?
Could you tell the difference?
Yeah, you used less aura the second time.
Okay, you pass.
You'll have an easier time with him
if you can tell the difference.
When Genthru prepares Little Flower,
he will shroud his hand with Gyo.
If he's just faking and planning
to attack you somewhere else,
he probably won't use Gyo.
If you can tell if his hand is covered
with Gyo when he grabs you,
it'll be simpler for you to know
which attack you should block.
So that's it.
You knew from my Gyo.
Cunning.
Let me repeat myself.
The shallow strategy you're using will backfire.
If you're caught by Little Flower when
you aren't using enough aura to defend,
a hit to the face will blow off your eyes,
nose, and mouth with no hope of repair.
A hit to the arms or legs will incinerate skin,
severely damaging any nerves or muscle.
You'll have no fingers or toes left.
It's not possible for you to use Gyo to guard
against every attack that uses Gyo.
Now what?
I'm not interested in continuing this.
Fighting you has made me see something...
You have talent and a promising future.
And many other chances.
Don't you think it's meaningless to throw
all that away just for your pride?
Just give up, stupid kid!
If he makes like he's going to use
both hands to blow you up,
that's a red light.
Then it'll be time to stick to the plan.
Sorry, Bisky and Killua.
I'm gonna be selfish here.
I have to give it a try...
Because I just had a great idea!
If you seriously mean that,
you should surrender, Genthru!
A shame...
Let me show you
that there are some things worse than death.
I'll blow up both your arms.
Use Gyo to protect the one you want to keep.
After that, I'll blow up your
remaining arm and left leg.
Use Gyo to protect the one you want to keep.
And so on...
Until you're out of limbs.
Go ahead and try!
Very well.
Take this!
Wh-What happened?
Blood?
Damage?
He landed a hit?
First comes rock!
Crap...
Move... Dodge!
Rock...
Paper...
Rock!
Did he hit me?
No, I tripped.
What was that?
What just happened?
Now I understand...
Th-This kid...
He sacrificed both hands!
But the damage wasn't distributed evenly!
He probably gave up completely on his left hand,
protected his right hand with 30% of his aura,
and focused the remaining 70% on his legs...
to attack me!
I use aura both to explode targets and
to shield my hand from the blast.
If I use it on both hands,
I won't have much left for the rest of myself.
He took advantage of that!
Still, no one sane would actually try that!
I gave him a pretty good scare!
Damn...
This hurts like hell.
But...
I'm going for it!
I'm done...
He's done?
Is he giving up?
Of course...
That makes sense.
He's lost his left hand,
and his right is badly injured.
And he managed to land a hit on me.
He must be satisfied now.
I'm done being selfish...
Time to get serious!
Let's do this, Genthru!
Th-This kid's
totally insane!
Book!
A card?
He shouldn't have anything to concern me.
The card transformed?
Paladin's Necklace?!
What is he planning?
This is your last chance to surrender.
Once I use this, you could end up dead.
You're clearly bluffing!
Now wait...
This is my chance.
Book.
I give up.
Obviously, you're never going to surrender.
Take them.
I'll silence him.
Crushing his windpipe and
knocking him out would be best.
Then I can take the cards from his binder.
I have one request.
What is it?
Could you leave me this card?
Bah...
He blocked my second attack with Gyo!
But I did manage to crush his windpipe!
He won't be able to use Book or Gain anymore.
Genthru...
You have made the worst mistake you could make.
Gasoline
A glass container
filled with fuel.
Highly flammable.
One minute!
What's that smell?
He can't use Little Flower any longer.
I'm going to take him down!
Book.
Oh, so this is gasoline...
Very clever.
True, I cannot use Little Flower now...
However, I have another ability,
Countdown.
The ability that lets me set a bomb
when I touch someone and say "Bomber."
The bomb can only be disarmed
by touching me and saying,
"I caught the Bomber."
This one is ten times stronger than Little Flower.
You won't be able to block it with Nen.
All the activation requirements have been met.
If I touch you and say, "Bomber,"
the countdown will begin.
Try to run away...
If you still have the strength.
The requirements have been met... for me!
First comes rock...
This is his earlier attack...
If get too close, I'm done for.
Is he trying to keep me back?
Rock...
Paper...
Rock!
A pitfall?
But he's falling with me!
It's deep...
I can't climb back up.
But he should be in the same boat.
He's ended up cornering himself.
He's gone.
Genthru...
If a card is removed from
the binder for a minute,
it reverts to an item.
Large Rock
A rock?!
First comes rock...
Rock...
Paper...
W-W-Wait!
I surrender! I surrender!
Rock!
Osu!
Are you awake?
Summon your binder.
We want you to return the cards you stole
from the people you backstabbed.
On one condition...
Use Archangel to heal Bara.
We have a Clone card.
Don't worry.
That was always part of the plan.
We brought six copies of Clone.
Book...
Gain!
What is your wish?
We need you to heal his hands and throat.
Actually, can you just heal all his injuries?
Easily done.
Then I shall heal his body.
I'm healed!
Then, farewell.
All right!
Okay, here's the extra Archangel.
Gain!
Next up is Killua.
Genthru, we're going to use your binder.
Go ahead.
Clone on!
Breath of Archangel has reached
its maximum card limit.
Clone will be destroyed.
W-W-Wait!
What's going on?!
Did I do something wrong?
No, it's Goreinu.
Huh?
He used Clone or Transform to increase the
number of Breath of Archangel vouchers.
So two of his vouchers became
Breath of Archangel cards.
Another player has used Contact to reach you.
Yo, it's Goreinu.
Looks like you won.
But I don't approve of this.
If you plan to use Breath of Archangel
to heal these murderers,
the trade is off!
You okay with using it on me?
Of course.
I am an assassin.
Eh?
I've killed more people than these guys.
Each player in this game risks their
life in one way or another.
That doesn't make it okay to kill others.
But all the people I've killed were
not nearly as prepared to die.
I'm worse than these guys.
No, you aren't like them.
I like you, but I hate their guts!
That isn't a valid reason!
I don't need a reason...
What counts is how I feel.
Aren't you guys the same way?
But we don't think it's right
to let them die because we hate them.
In battle, both sides risk their lives,
and are prepared to kill.
But that doesn't apply once the fight is over.
I haven't forgiven Genthru for
killing all those players...
But the three of us agreed before the fight
that we'd bring six Clone cards.
I don't really remember why we decided that,
but it wasn't based on logic or reason.
It was just the decision that came naturally to us.
Once the fight was over and we'd
obtained Breath of Archangel,
we planned to heal everyone.
All three of us made the decision,
so we wanted to stick to it.
But I understand how you feel,
and we can't change your mind.
Sorry, Killua...
Could you wait a little longer?
No problem.
I'll recover on my own in a while.
The situation's changed, so we
can't use Clone anymore.
There's only one Breath of Archangel left.
Only one? Isn't that the original?
Use it on Genthru.
I'm fine...
Okay, let's use Accompany to go to Masadora.
Yeah.
Hey, wait up...
Fine, you can have Breath of Archangel.
Huh?
Really? Are you sure?
Yeah, actually...
Before you told me all this,
I planned to give it to you.
Not just Archangel, but all of our cards.
What?!
Tsezgerra, his team, and I all agreed.
We've decided to give up on the game.
Wow, I'm completely healed!
Oh, so Mr. Battera...
Yeah, he paid Tsezgerra and his
team for breaking his promise.
I got four billion out of it.
Four billion?!
Hey...
Share some of the wealth!
Wh-What are you talking about?
Each of the four of us gets one billion!
Eh?!
It's only fair...
I couldn't have done this on my own.
It was only possible because
I teamed up with you guys.
I can't believe it...
You're such a nice guy!
Anyway, you can take all the cards.
On one condition!
You must be the first players to beat the game.
Yep!
Not a problem.
That gives you ninety-nine restricted slot cards.
Leaving only #0.
One card to go...
Yeah.
Ninety-seven, ninety-eight...
And this is...
Maid Panda
A species on the
verge of extinction.
Tidy, loves to cook,
and some individuals
enjoy Western clothing
and gardening.
Excellent at taking
care of human children.
ninety-nine!
This announcement is for all players.
A player has collected ninety-nine
restricted slot cards.
Ten minutes from now, in honor of this event,
there will be a quiz contest
for all Greed Island players.
There will be one hundred total questions
dealing with restricted slot cards.
The player who has the most
correct answers will receive
#0 Ruler's Blessing as a prize.
Please wait with your binders open.
Questions about restricted slot cards, huh?
I get it.
The questions are probably
designed so that players
who mainly stole cards can't answer them.
Someone's coming!
Wait, more over here!
The long battle has finally
reached its final stage.
G.I. Tutorial
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!
Today, we introduce the card Transform.
Transform
Change one card in your possession into any
other card in your possession. (Card will now
count against the limit of new card type. If limit has already been reached, nothing will happen,
and the Transform card will be destroyed.)
[SR][NORM]
You can change one card into any other card.
Gon, quick!
Transform on! Gold Dust Girl.
Gold Dust Girl
A girl who releases golden dust.
One bath a day will net 500G.
Very shy and quiet.
Gain.
G.I. Tutorial
Continue!
Next time: Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.
Think I can make a hundred friends?
You'll be fine.
If your eyes meet, you're friends.
﻿Don't worry.
We aren't here to get in your way.
In fact, you could say we're here to help.
Help?
Yeah.
If we get the top score on
the quiz and win the card,
we want to sell it to you for 2.5 billion.
That's only five percent of your reward.
It's a reasonable price, yeah?
Oh, right...
They haven't heard about Battera yet.
Sure, if you get the top score.
Everyone else is here for the chance
to sell us the final card, too?
With the game ending,
they're all hoping to share in the reward.
It looks like they're going
to take the quiz in teams.
What should we do?
What? We should do it by ourselves.
Yeah.
Whoever scores lower gets penalized.
Okay, I'm in!
Honestly... They've got guts.
They just came from a fight to the death,
and now they're facing the final event
in the game with such confidence.
I bet those two enjoyed this
game more than anyone.
Keep it up.
Ging's Friends x And x True Friends
The quiz contest open to all players has begun.
Then I will now start the quiz.
Question one.
What is the name of the elder
who gives an important hint
about #1, Patch of Forest?
A: Hira.
B: Hida.
C: Hiso.
D: Mayu.
E: Hima.
Damn! I'm stumped on the first one!
Five choices?
What is the condition to obtain
#17, Breath of Archangel?
I caught the Bomber.
#84,
Paladin's Necklace, is offered as a prize
in a monthly tournament of what?
Yes!
B. Rock-Paper-Scissors
C. Two-Man Tug-of-War
D. Snowball Fight
E. Kick the Can
Okay!
And now for the final question...
What is the name of card #0?
A: Ruler's Banquet.
B: Ruler's Invitation.
C: Ruler's Reception.
Can't remember...
C. Ruler's Reception
D. Ruler's Welcome
E. Ruler's Blessing
The quiz is over.
I will now announce the player with the top score.
With a score of 87 out of 100 points,
our top scoring player
is Gon.
Yes!
We have all one hundred!
You did it.
I hate to say it, but you beat us...
Congratulations.
Thanks.
That means Killua gets penalized.
Damn...
How many points did I get?
Ruler's Invitation?
Ruler's Invitation
An invitation from
this island's ruler.
The envelope contains
a map that shows the
castle and a badge.
Player must have badge
to enter the castle.
Looks like only the one with
the badge is invited.
So Limeiro is the capital?
I have to go alone?
We'll wait for you by the castle.
Hey, he really got it.
That kid really collected all the cards.
Hey, let's have a contest with
all your cards at stake.
Sorry, but you don't have a choice.
Then I'll take an Accompany card.
Wait, that won't work.
We haven't been to Limeiro before.
So we should use Drift...
Since we've been to the other cities before.
Drift
Transports you to a
previously unvisited city.
(If all cities have been
visited, Drift is used,
without transporting player.)
[SR][NORM]
In that case, I'll use Drift to go to Limeiro,
then come back for you guys.
Accompany will work after that.
Drift on!
Bingo!
Accompany
Warp all players within 20 meters
of caster to city (must have been visited)
or player of your choice (must have
been met inside the game).
[SR][NORM]
Let's go, Gon.
Yep.
Accompany on!
Limeiro!
Those kids are amazing.
They wiped the floor with the Belum brothers.
Of course...
They even defeated the bombers.
It's true,
those boys are much stronger
than when I first met them.
But they're still weaker than
Genthru in raw power.
They must have executed a brilliant plan...
Well, no matter.
I'll let you have the reward for beating the game.
Magnetic Force on.
Chrollo Lucilfer.
I'll head back to reality and
make a fortune exorcising Nen.
I wonder what he's feeling.
What he's feeling?
He might meet Ging, after all.
The father he's been searching for all this time.
Welcome to Greed Island Castle.
Come in.
This place is a dump!
I've brought the top scorer, Gon-kun.
Oh, hey! I've been waiting for you!
I hear you're Ging's son?
Why don't you have a seat?
Uh...
Where should I sit?
Isn't there any open space?
Clear some space, then...
Like this!
Uh...
Wait, where did I put it?
Oh! Here it is!
There you go.
Ruler's Blessing
Castle awarded to the
winner of the quiz.
Comes with capital city
(population 10,000).
The city's residents
will obey any laws or
commands you give.
Ruler's Blessing,
the reward for the top scorer.
How about it?!
Isn't it cool?
Are you amazed? Well?
There are 10,000 people in this city.
One of them could be...
Wait, did I get your hopes up?
Well?
Or were you just thinking that
Ging could be the ruler?
I was not!
I never considered that Ging might be here.
Oh, really now?
That's good, then...
Since he's not.
Dwun-san, can we get to business?
Oh, my bad.
Listen up.
You've collected all one hundred cards.
Which triggers a new event.
Hmm...
Oh, here it is!
This is it.
Open it up.
You can place three restricted
slot cards in this binder.
You can then take those three back
for use in the real world.
However!
You cannot take multiple
copies of the same card.
You must choose three different restricted
slot cards from the hundred in your binder.
Okay, you've reached the ending...
Do you want the normal ending,
or the ending just for you?
Just for me?
Yep, that's right.
Which one do you want? Well?
Then I'll take the normal one.
Why would you choose that one?
I didn't clear the game alone, and if it's
the normal ending, my friends
can watch with me, right?
I see...
Dwun-san?
Huh?
Would you stop teasing him?
I'm sorry...
There's no such thing as an ending just for you.
What? Really?
However, there's a message we've been told
to give you only after you beat the game.
Sorry for taking so long to introduce ourselves.
I'm List.
He's Dwun.
As you probably know,
we're friends of your old man.
This game was created by Ging
and ten of his friends.
The name "Greed Island" was created
from the first letter in each of their names.
Your father was in charge,
so we wanted a word that began
with "G," and settled on "Greed."
Have you met Razor?
He's the "R," and I'm the "L."
The girl who explains the game at the start
is the twin of the girl you see
when leaving the island.
Eeta and Elena.
Both names begin with "E."
And then, we have "D"!
Wanna hear my story? Well?
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?
Y-Yeah...
Okay, pay attention.
You see, that Ging...
was a totally mean guy!
Totally mean!
My name is Dwun!
What do you think is the first letter?
Huh? Isn't it "D"?
Even you, huh?
Of course you'd think so...
After all, you're Ging's son.
Weren't we talking about "D"?
It's "W!" "W!"
W-d-w-u-n-e.
Wdwune!
That was my name!
But even my oldest friends
thought it began with "D."
So when we decided on the
game's name, I was clear...
That my name began with "W."
What do you think Ging said?
Really?
Then, ditch the "W."
Starting now, your name is D-w-u-n...
Dwun.
Can you believe him?
He changed my name without asking.
Just so the title of the game would work!
What's really amazing
is that Ging had legally changed
the name a minute later.
He only needed a phone and a computer.
What's worse is that he even removed
the "E" because he got confused!
But your luck has been better as a result.
I guess! Ever since...
Once I've chosen the three cards,
I'm supposed to go to the port.
Did they tell you about your father?
Yeah, but they don't know
where he is right now.
Oh...
So I guess the game didn't have any clues.
Well, that's what the starting message said.
Yeah, that's true.
So, what will you do for the three cards?
How about we each pick one?
Blue Planet
A gemstone with an
incomparable blue shine.
Its composition matches
no known minerals,
so it's named for its
otherworldly nature.
Then I want Blue Planet!
This is still the best one!
I can't wait to see the real thing...
Which one do you want, Killua?
I'm still thinking.
Have you decided, Gon?
Yeah, I think so.
Really? Which one?
Let's see...
This one.
Which one?
Wait, why this one?
I get it.
That makes sense.
You're only allowed to take
restricted slot cards...
Yep, that sounds fun!
When did you have the idea?
The moment I saw this card.
Paladin's Necklace
When a player wears this,
all spells targeting player
will be reflected.
Can also dispel curses
placed on any card
touched by player.
But this one won't be enough.
Right, we also need this one.
Transform
Change one card in your possession into any
other card in your possession. (Card will now
count against the limit of new card type. If limit has already been reached, nothing will happen,
and the Transform card will be destroyed.)
[SR][NORM]
Eh?
Do you think this will work?
Yeah.
And this is the only way to do it!
Wait, what is this?
What are you talking about?
You're okay with Blue Planet, Bisky?
Let me in on this!
Congratulations on clearing the game.
Please choose three restricted
slot cards from your binder.
You've chosen #2, Patch of Shore,
Patch of Shore
The entrance to an
underwater cavern known
as the Sea God's Grotto.
The cavern changes
every time you enter.
Blue Planet
A gemstone with an
incomparable blue shine.
Its composition matches
no known minerals,
so it's named for its
otherworldly nature.
#81, Blue Planet,
Paladin's Necklace
When a player wears this,
all spells targeting player
will be reflected.
Can also dispel curses
placed on any card
touched by player.
and #84, Paladin's Necklace.
Are you sure these are the three cards you want?
Yep.
Then I will now return your ring.
Good work.
Thank you...
Uh, Elena-san!
You remembered my name?
Thank you.
Goodbye.
Welcome back!
Yeah.
We're back in the real world now?
I can't tell.
Well, the game was part of the real world.
Hey, hurry up!
Bring out your binder...
Book.
Gain!
This is it!
This is what I wanted!
The Blue Planet I've dreamed of for so long!
I'm so happy!
What should I name it?
Pla-chan?
Maybe Blue-chan?
Planet-chan?
Yep, I'll go with Planet-chan!
So, are you sure about the two you picked?
Yeah, these are the best ones, right?
Yep.
Then let's give it a go!
Yeah!
Gain!
Give it to me, Killua.
Yes! It worked!
Okay!
I see.
You used Transform to make
Accompany a restricted slot card,
then used Paladin's Necklace to revert it.
That's clever thinking...
But I'm surprised you'd do
all that for an Accompany,
rather than choose a restricted slot card.
Yeah...
Well, if I hadn't been the first
one of us to enter the game,
I probably wouldn't have noticed.
Remember when we played
rock-paper-scissors here?
Rock-paper-scissors?
Yeah.
I was the first to enter the game.
And while I was waiting for Killua,
no one else was around.
Which means the first person I met in the game
should have been the second
one to go in, Goreinu-san.
But when I checked my binder,
there was someone I met before him.
Nigg
Goreinu
Ging is spelled G-i-n-g.
Oh, so Nigg is an anagram!
My guess is that when I was a
baby, I came here with Ging.
He was probably trying to tell me this:
If I'm ready to give up everything to find him,
I have to get strong enough
to clear the game...
Your dedication is really something.
Well? What will you do once you find Ging?
Naturally, I'll introduce him to Killua!
My best friend in the world!
Stupid! Cut that out!
It's embarrassing...
Really...
Stop it...
I can't take this!
It must be age.
It doesn't take much to make me cry...
Hey, wanna come with us to see Ging?
No, I'll pass.
I'm not interested in men who already have kids.
Okay.
If I stay with you any longer,
I really will get too attached.
Well, take care, Bisky.
Yeah.
You, too.
Thank you very much!
Osu!
Accompany on!
Nigg!
Bye-bye.
Gon has cleared the game his father created,
becoming much stronger.
Is the one waiting before him really Ging?
G.I. Tutorial
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!
Today, we beat Greed Island.
We've introduced a whole bunch of cards.
I did all the introducing!
You just fooled aro—
Game over.
Killua Zoldyck                                        Gon Freecs
Next time: Reunion x And x Understanding.
Hey, Killua...
Re...
...union and...
...understanding.
﻿Ging is spelled G-i-n-g.
Oh, so Nigg is an anagram!
My guess is that when I was a
baby, I came here with Ging.
He was probably trying to tell me this:
If I'm ready to give up everything to find him,
I have to get strong enough
to clear the game...
Well? What will you do once you find Ging?
Naturally, I'll introduce him to Killua!
My best friend in the world!
Accompany on!
Nigg!
Reunion x And x Understanding
Is that
Gon's...
G-Ging...
I got a slot machine in my mouth!
It goes from 1 to 9.
Each number summons a different weapon.
This is my
Crazy Slots!
Crazy Slots:
Psychotic Clown
Give me something good...
4!
Damn, bad roll.
Shut up!
You should be grateful, you idiot!
An ant?
Are you hurt?
Is that Ging?
That isn't Ging...
Hey...
What was that about?
First you push us down, then you fire at us!
Enough fooling around!
Fooling around?
I was being dead serious.
If I hadn't opened fire,
you would have been attacked.
By what?!
The ant you shot?
Ow!
What is this?
Idiot!
That's no ordinary ant.
It's a Chimera Ant.
A Chimera Ant?
An aggressive, carnivorous insect,
currently under class-1 quarantine.
From time to time, they even attack humans.
You were standing right in front of their nest.
Had I not fired,
a Chimera Ant army would
have consumed you by now.
I feel like this has happened before...
Don't worry, it's not serious.
Apply this.
It's an antibiotic.
What? That's it?
Let's go nuts, man!
Shut up... Go away.
You should leave, as well.
Damn...
Because of this interruption,
I'll need to start over.
But the nest was destroyed.
Man, forced to take another life...
Ah!
Man, forced to take another life...
Are you...
Are you the one
who saved me back then?
Back then?
On Whale Island, after I stumbled into
the territory of a Foxbear with its cub.
Whale Island?
That time, too,
you had to kill, in order to protect me.
Oh, yes. I remember now.
I never expected to run into you again here.
You've grown, Gon.
How do you know my name?
I heard it from your dad,
Ging-san.
Old man, you know Ging?
Old...
Yeah, my name is Kite.
Ging-san was my master.
Oh, so you're also pro Hunters?
Yep. Are you one too, Kite-san?
Call me Kite.
It's awkward being addressed
formally by my master's son.
Okay.
Then, you're one too, Kite?
Yeah, Ging-san was the one who
made me a top-class Hunter.
He was my teacher and benefactor.
If I hadn't met Ging-san,
I'd have died long ago, in the alley of a slum.
Wait up!
Damned brat!
He swiped the bread that
I'd managed to find...
He isn't escaping today.
My bread!
Bastard,
you won't get away today!
Ow!
What is this?
What are you doing?
Stop it...
You live with these guys?
That sounds fun.
That was how you met Ging?
Yeah...
Ging-san said that good Hunters
are well-liked by animals.
He said I had potential, so I got interested.
And you became his student?
I had to force him to teach me.
He hated dealing with any kind of hassle...
So I was never his student officially.
But I was a stubborn one...
I kept bugging him.
Eventually, I started to develop my Nen,
and he began teaching me to hunt.
As a result, I was able to pass the
Hunter Exam with little difficulty.
But before Ging-san was satisfied,
I had to clear another hurdle.
Can you guess what it was?
I think I might know.
Oh?
No, I definitely know.
This is what Ging would have said...
"Try to catch me."
Exactly. You're right.
I knew it! I figured that was it!
But as far as I knew, he was
the world's greatest Hunter.
It was going to be the most difficult hunt ever.
There were no clues or leads to begin from.
And I didn't hear word of a single sighting.
He'd managed to completely erase
his existence from this world.
Like a super-powered form of Zetsu?
So...
So what happened in the end?
I was struggling, and grasping for a single clue,
so I went to his home.
To Whale Island.
That was when I met you, Gon.
But back then, I didn't realize
that you were Ging-san's son.
I didn't learn that until I'd found Ging-san
and told him about what had
happened on Whale Island.
That was my kid... His name is Gon.
Thanks for hitting him.
It's common sense to avoid
Foxbear territory when they're raising young.
Ging-san wasn't surprised
that I went to Whale Island,
or that I met you there.
It was almost as though he'd expected it.
Looking back,
it may be that everything's gone
according to Ging-san's plans.
Are you saying he set all this up?
Well, I can't prove it.
You might be right.
Razor was waiting for me.
And Dwun and List.
Razor? Dwun?
Yeah, in a game called Greed Island...
It's a long story.
In the game, a guy named Razor was
waiting for me, at Ging's request.
My son will come here one day.
When that happens, give him a good beating.
Does that mean I'm allowed to kill him?
Don't get too cocky.
He is my son.
Then, I'm counting on you, Razor.
Dwun and List were among Ging's ten friends
who helped him create Greed Island.
Oh, Razor was also one of them...
Anyway, those three were waiting for me.
When I learned that, I realized something.
If Ging planned for me to go to Greed
Island and meet his friends,
meeting Bisky and the others may have
been another part of his plan.
In that case,
it's possible that Ging also planned
that you'd meet Kite here.
Huh?
Oh, that's right!
You must have been to Greed Island before.
Me?
Yeah, did you register under the name "Nigg"?
Nigg?
No, I don't recall that name.
Wait...
I do remember Ging-san taking
me inside a game...
I knew it!
Greed Island...
Yes, I believe that was its title.
But I can't remember if I used an alias.
That must be it...
Ging must have had you use the name Nigg.
Damn! He tricked me!
You were so sure you'd meet him, huh?
Are you sure this was the right decision,
Ging?
Can you make it so that using
Magnetic Force will send Gon to me,
while using Accompany will send him to Kite?
I can...
Why do you want me to do that?
If he uses Magnetic Force to see me on
his own, I'm willing to meet with him.
But I can't meet him if he's so gutless
that he has to bring friends.
Why would bringing friends mean he's gutless?
I don't understand.
Never mind... Just do it!
You'd probably just be
embarrassed if he brought a crowd.
Shut up! Just do it!
He's so weird...
Shy and stubborn.
I feel sorry for Gon-kun.
I understand.
So the game Greed Island was
created to train you boys.
Only Gon, really.
I just tagged along for the ride.
That may have been part of Ging's plan, too.
Even me?
Nah, that's impossible.
However,
it appears that our meeting
here wasn't coincidence.
Yeah, I agree.
There must be a deeper meaning to this.
Meaning?
Razor waited inside the
game to make you stronger,
so one would think Ging must
have some role for Kite to play.
A role...
Your final test was finding Ging, right?
Yeah.
That sounds like a daunting task.
The best Hunters in this world
are masters of not only hunting,
but concealing themselves as well.
Yet you were able to find him.
Oh...
Yeah, that's true.
Once you cleared your final test,
Ging must have decided you were
worthy of handling this.
Handling this? Handling what?
Handling what? Basically...
Thanks for hitting him.
Say, Gon...
Want me to tell you Ging-san's
current whereabouts?
No, I'll find him on my own.
A good response.
Anyway, tell me about Ging.
Tell me everything you know!
How to help two-headed wolves breed?
Ging is involved in that stuff?
Sure, Ging-san is involved with a
wide range of Hunter activities.
He's never formally applied
because he doesn't want
to expend the energy, but he's as
qualified as a Triple Star Hunter.
Triple Star?
Stars are awarded to Hunters who
perform extraordinary tasks.
Those responsible for
historical discoveries or global
achievements receive three stars.
There are fewer than ten of
these Hunters in the world.
The title "Triple Star Hunter"
is reserved for the very best.
So Ging is as good as the best!
Kite...
A Hunter who earned Ging's respect.
Ging-san is also famous
for discovering the Lurka Ruins
and the Kongo gold vein.
Oh, I've heard of the Lurka Ruins!
Kite, student of Ging...
While his meeting
with Gon and Killua signaled the
beginning of a new adventure...
On the Yorbian continent, in the
southernmost of the Balsa Islands,
a prologue to unparalleled fear
was quietly but steadily unfolding.
Not enough.
These creatures are not enough,
no matter how many I eat.
But I cannot move...
Stay calm.
Focus on recovering my energy.
I must heal before I can take the next step.
I have a duty to fulfill...
I must give birth to the King!
I am the Queen!
Next time: Unease x And x Sighting.
Are you uneasy, Killua?
D-Don't embarrass me!
﻿I have a duty to fulfill...
I must give birth to the King!
I am the Queen!
Unease x And x Sighting
After using Accompany,
Gon and Killua were transported
to Ging's student, Kite.
After Gon remembered having
met Kite years before,
he felt that Ging intended
for this meeting to occur,
and his interest in Kite grew.
Hey, what kind of work do you do, Kite?
Biological surveying.
I focus on discovering and
researching new species.
Oh, have you heard of the Camp Tiger?
Camp Tiger?
They can use fire.
They use branches that have been
ignited by lightning as live kindle.
Other than certain Magical
Beasts that walk on two legs,
they're the first of their kind:
animals that eat their meat cooked, not raw.
Wow, they're really cooking it.
They really are using fire!
Hey, what else is there?
Oh, yeah...
You said the thing that attacked
me was a Chimera Ant?
Yes, a Chimera Ant.
Under a class-1 quarantine.
Normally, no one would be allowed
near such a dangerous insect.
Did you discover them?
No, I specialize in larger creatures.
But currently, I'm investigating these insects.
Something has been bothering me...
But it appears that now, I'll have
to move to a different location.
I must make a call, but I'm not
getting any reception here.
A call?
I'm working with others.
Seven of us are working as a team.
I guess I must wait for their arrival.
Once they're here, I'll introduce you.
They're amateurs, but they're still skilled Hunters.
Oh?
Ah, speak of the devil.
Kite, who are these kids?
My friends.
They dropped by for a visit on their travels.
Oh, it's a pleasure to meet
you all the way out here.
I'm Spinner Clow.
Call me Spin!
Nice to meet you.
I'm Gon Freecss.
Nice to meet you, Spin.
Freecss...
Wait, is this...
Yes, Ging-san's son.
Really?!
And you? Not you, too?
No, not me.
My name is Killua Zoldyck.
Zoldyck...
Um, forgive me if I'm wrong, but are you
part of the famous family of assassins?
Yeah, but I quit.
Additionally, they are both pro Hunters.
So you should show some respect.
Wow!
Man, that was a shock!
We've been conducting biological
surveys with Kite for three years,
but this is the most incredible
organism we've ever seen!
Yeah, no kidding...
I don't think we finished our introductions.
I'm Monta Yuras.
But call me Mon.
Nice to meet you, Mon.
I'm Stick Dinner.
I handle the cooking.
Know why?
Because my name is Dinner.
Nice meeting you.
My name is Banana Kavaro.
Good to meet you.
We have two others on our team.
Where are Podungo and Lin?
They're both headed toward
the area of the sighting.
They always move so fast.
Oh, and you were right, Kite...
This looks just like the claw
of a Chimera Ant queen.
We ran some computer analyses,
and the result was a 99% match.
Can I see it?
Sure.
This is a Chimera Ant claw?
It's as big as a human finger.
Does that mean there are huge ants?
We don't know.
Maybe one mutated and grew really big?
That's possible, though it may also belong
to a completely different species.
Regardless, we just don't know right now.
That's why we're investigating.
It all started with the wonkiest little thing...
His name was Won!
He was a Kakin official.
What's Kakin?
Right here.
It's this wild land, in the middle
of the Azian continent.
We had just completed a biological
survey they had requested when...
Magnificent.
You've completed two hundred years'
worth of work for this agency...
To be honest, I regret that I am
unable to pay you a bonus.
Don't say that, Won-san.
We enjoyed ourselves.
In lieu of that,
I'll be sure to recommend you
to other friendly nations.
We appreciate it.
Oh, that's right!
I'm going to ramble a bit.
I believe part of a very strange species was
brought to the Southern Piece auction...
There's suspicion that it's from
an unidentified organism,
so the seller couldn't list it in the catalog,
but since they'd have to donate it
to a government agency otherwise,
they hoped a licensed Hunter would
buy it from them for a high price.
Here you are.
Well, Lin?
Th-This clearly belongs to an
unidentified organism, yes.
F-From what I can see,
it resembles an insect's leg...
B-But no known insects have l-legs this large.
And the claw exhibits traits
not found among insects...
A leg typically has two claws, but this has six.
It almost looks as though the tarsi
evolved into something like fingers?
Yes, and this part is spiny,
so it could be the tibia.
If we take a sample and study
it further, we'll learn more.
Could you give us a small part?
Since Won-san referred you
to us, we cannot refuse.
Let's look into this, then.
We'll send you any results, once we have them.
Appreciated.
Chimera Ant...
Where did Lin and Podungo go?
Somewhere south of Yorknew City.
The person who found the insect leg
apparently lives in a city by the ocean.
Sorry you won't be able to catch your breath,
but we should hurry after them.
Hey, can we come with you?
Hmm?
Sure.
Yes!
Glad to have you.
Having two pro Hunters with us is reassuring.
And this is Ging-san's son and
one of the Zoldyck family!
Oh, sorry...
It's no big deal.
Anyway, you kids are already pros at your age?
We weren't born with the talent...
Talent, talent... Guess I have a
talent for saying "talent," huh?
In this brief period of time,
they've become friends.
Good Hunters are well-liked by animals.
And also blessed with good friends.
Gon might be the real deal...
He'll find you soon, Ging-san.
Not enough... Not enough...
I need more, bigger food.
It's been days...
No, it's been months since it last rained here.
The weather is unusual this year.
It's possible that this is affecting
the wildlife in some way.
So the insect with the large leg
could have been a mutation
influenced by those conditions.
But why would it have grown larger?
In order to survive, right?
If it's bigger, it'd have a better
chance of securing food.
But that would mean it'd need more, as well.
Being larger doesn't always aid survival.
I believe that this is
related to the Chimera Ant's unique
nature, not to the environment.
I agree.
Because they reproduce in a way
not found in any other organism.
What do you mean?
They reproduce through a special
process known as phagogenesis.
Phagogenesis?
What's that?
Phagogenesis
When a Chimera Ant queen eats other organisms,
she is able to pass traits on
from those organisms to the next generation.
And she can also eat multiple species
to pass on a mix of genes to her offspring.
With each feeding, she lays one to five eggs.
The first generation of births has
no reproductive capability,
so they become worker or soldier ants.
They work in service to the queen
and her eventual successors.
Those successors are the king and
queen of the next generation.
The queen is thus always looking to
consume the genes of strong organisms,
so she can pass them to her offspring.
And she may consume any species she
particularly likes to extinction.
To extinction?!
Yes, her voracious appetite can drive her
to consume her own weight many
times over, in a single day.
That's why Chimera Ants are
under a class-1 quarantine.
So if she sets her eyes on you, you're finished?
Judging from the size of that claw,
her length is at least two meters.
That thing could devour a human in no time.
Yes, you are correct.
Stay back! Go away!
B-Big Brother...
Reina, stay close to me.
Take that!
It's okay now.
Thank you!
You can count on your big brother.
I'll always keep you safe!
Yeah!
Okay, let's go home.
Hey, my brother was amazing!
There was a big snake, but he was like,
"Stay back! Go away!"
Whack!
Come now, don't wave your spoon around.
It's bad manners.
But that's what he did.
Yes, yes. I know.
That was very brave.
If a big snake showed up,
your mother might be too scared to move.
You're truly a young man, Kurt.
Yeah, I guess.
You're already nine...
And a reliable big brother.
You must continue to look after Reina.
I'm counting on you, Kurt.
I'm counting on you, Brother.
Yeah, you can count on me!
I'll keep you both safe forever!
This area is about to hatch.
Soldiers, hear me!
My duty is to give birth to the King.
In order to give birth to a strong king,
I require large quantities of highly nutritious food.
Search out the best food you can find!
This area will also hatch soon.
I require a large nest in
which to birth a strong king.
I also need time to rest, free from concerns
of outside disturbances, during the pregnancy.
In order to give birth to a strong
king, I need strong soldiers.
Are you okay?
Uh-huh, thank you...
Hey, Brother...
When I grow up, I'm gonna marry you.
Sure.
Let's wake up early tomorrow
and go fishing at the river.
Yeah.
We can cook some fish to surprise Mom.
Uh-huh, I can't wait.
This is enough fish for a feast.
Yep.
B-Big Brother...
Big Brother!
Reina, it's okay.
I'll...
Your big brother will protect you!
I promised Mom!
I'll keep you safe!
Go away...
Go away!
This is delicious,
and very nutritious...
The ultimate food.
I need more of this species.
They're the ones I mentioned on
the phone, Gon and Killua.
Oh, I'm Lin Koshi.
N-Nice to meet you.
My name's Podungo Lapoy.
Glad to have you on board.
Glad to be here, Lin-san, Podungo-san.
Hey.
Let's get down to business.
Where was the leg discovered?
On the beach over there.
A-According to the locals,
it washed up on sh-shore.
There's a forest right behind us...
It'll be difficult to find the
Chimera Ant if it ran in there.
We can't be certain that it's still alive.
We don't even know if it ended up
on the same island its leg drifted to.
Let's find out, then.
Here, remember this scent.
I'll help, too!
Huh?
His nose is as sharp as a dog's.
He can't find anything...
The scent may have disappeared.
It was raining.
I couldn't find anything, either.
That means the Chimera Ant isn't here.
It may have washed ashore elsewhere.
In which direction do the currents flow here?
It's complicated...
The direction is reversed
between day and night.
And it also changes with the seasons.
I've even heard it's different on certain days.
So it'll be tough to pinpoint a location...
It's too early to give up.
Let's split up and search.
You're right.
No luck...
Continuing to search blindly is pointless.
Let's return to Yorknew City.
We may be able to find a new lead.
Her length is at least two meters.
That thing could devour a human in no time.
A voracious appetite...
Phagogenesis.
Your Majesty...
Oh, you can speak?
So that I may fully receive,
understand, and execute your orders.
That pleases me.
I assign you to be a squadron leader.
I am most grateful.
I already have your mission.
Lead all the soldiers here on a mission
to capture my food...
Capture more of those highly
nutritious organisms for me.
At once!
A Chimera Ant has been born with human genes.
Kite's worst fears have been realized.
Next time: Very x Rapid x Reproduction.
My name is Gon Freecss.
My name is Killua Zoldyck.
What's your name?
﻿Lead all the soldiers here on a mission
to capture my food...
Capture more of those highly
nutritious organisms for me.
At once!
Very x Rapid x Reproduction
Class-1 quarantined insects
and insatiable carnivores: Chimera Ants.
Once they've evolved beyond
two meters in length,
humans no longer stand a chance.
Hey, what's that?
M-M-Monsters!
Listen carefully!
Target the fully grown ones.
They will provide the most nutrition.
Now go!
A Chimera Ant queen
moves repeatedly until she
finds a place she likes.
As she does, she births more and more
soldier ants to build her own army.
Once she's chosen a location,
she births a large number of carpenter ants,
which construct her castle with incredible speed.
From then on, the queen remains
within the castle until death.
So if a Queen grew to two meters tall
and were to set her sights on humans,
there should be entire villages
or towns of missing people.
I don't see anything...
I just checked the past six months,
and the largest group only numbered ten.
Say, can we look up missing people individually?
Don't be ridiculous.
You know how many hundreds of thousands
of people go missing worldwide?
We should be able to see which areas
have the highest concentrations.
No good... The data's two years old.
Perhaps we should start by checking for sightings.
If someone saw a two-meter insect,
they'd make a big fuss.
We tried that, of course.
But we couldn't find anything.
Maybe we're getting worked up over nothing...
Yeah.
Bring up the tidal data from
the day the arm was found.
The arm was discovered here...
Now go back ten days.
Locate any currents that may have carried
the arm to that location in that time.
What do you mean?
It's possible that the arm
was severed after the Chimera Ant made landfall.
That makes sense.
It could have come from any of the Balsa Islands...
Including the Mitene Union.
The Mitene Union...
Oh, where the NGL Autonomous Region is.
Yes, as well as East Gorteau.
There's no getting information
out of those two countries.
What's this NGL?
An acronym, standing for Neo-Green Life.
It's a country founded by people who wanted to
live in nature, away from machine civilization.
Here.
Mitene Union:
NGL Autonomous Region
Republic of Rokario
Hass Republic
Republic of West Gorteau
Republic of East Gorteau
They primarily communicate by letter.
Primary means of transportation is by horse.
Anyone knowingly bringing technology into
the country is subject to execution.
In '87,
a three-man TV crew was caught trying
to enter the country to get a story.
One was executed, and the
other two remain in prison.
Of its 2.17 million population,
99% belong to the Neo-Green Life Party,
with the rest being support volunteers.
If the Chimera Ant washed ashore there,
how would the NGL citizenry react?
They probably wouldn't do anything.
When a deadly epidemic spread throughout
the area, they let nature run its course,
refusing to admit international doctors.
And even if they tried to contact the outside,
it would be too late by the time word arrived.
If that arm belonged to the Chimera Ant queen,
she may have already begun to build her nest.
A contest?
Yeah...
Between you and me.
Let's see who can bring the Queen more humans.
I challenge you!
Hmph.
What?
You're running away?
Hey, accept my challenge!
Accept?
Are you issuing an order?
Why should I follow an order from you?
I can only follow the Queen's orders.
You're just scared of losing.
My squadron is comprised of elite soldiers.
I can beat any squadron in this castle!
Oh, I know...
I should get the other squadron leaders in on this.
If we all compete, we'll capture more prey.
More prey?
I see...
I agree with that idea.
If we gather more prey, the Queen will be pleased.
Okay, that settles it.
However, I believe that the
prey's quality also matters.
We must ensure that the Queen
eats highly nutritious humans.
That guy's such a stiff...
That's what makes him endearing.
He is dedicated and loyal.
I presume the human he was created
from was also quite earnest.
Hey, wait!
Weren't you supposed to get some rest?
I'll bring her back.
Don't bother, it won't help.
But she goes to the forest every morning,
and she spends the whole day searching.
Right, she'll probably collapse soon...
But she can't stop looking.
That's what it means to be a parent.
How many days has it been since
Kurt-kun and Reina-chan vanished?
It's like spirits whisked them away.
Big bugs...
Huh?
We haven't raided this area yet.
Mom!
It must be them...
Those monsters must have stolen your children!
Excellent.
This should suffice to please the Queen.
Wh-What's happening?
Exterminate the insects quickly.
That's Gyro's order.
Gyro? What's that?
Our king's name!
Damn!
I bought tickets to the Mitene Union.
But to reach NGL, we have to
take an airship to the neighboring
Republic of Rokario,
and travel by land from there.
It "ant" gonna be easy to get into
a country of such nasty rumors.
Just kidding.
Nasty rumors?
What do you mean?
Have you heard of D²?
D²?
It's an ingestible drug that's propagating rapidly
throughout urban areas worldwide.
It's derived from the bila tree,
native to the Mitene Union.
And they claim
that over 80% of the world's
bila trees are located in NGL.
So the nasty rumors are saying that the
drug is being manufactured in NGL?
They're only rumors.
No one has been able to publicly prove it.
After all, the country's locked down tight.
When people try to get in to
investigate, they're executed.
Executed...
He wasn't executed?
No, if he'd been captured trying
to uncover NGL's secrets,
he'd have probably been executed
like that TV crewman.
But this reporter was wearing a wire,
from which we intercepted the final message.
When the message was played...
M-Monsters...
Giant bugs!
Giant bugs?
What do you think?
That isn't enough information to be sure...
As a Magical Beast Hunter,
I'll have to see for myself.
Then that settles it.
I'll get three tickets.
Make it four.
Ponzu...
I'm coming with you.
You can't.
This is too dangerous,
and you don't have a professional license yet.
And we're talking about NGL...
That's why I should come.
You aren't allowed to bring technology into NGL.
If they discover you with cell phones
or wireless communicators,
you'll be arrested right away.
So if there's any trouble, you'll need me...
Or rather, you'll need them.
They can carry a letter anywhere.
I get it.
They'll certainly come in handy.
It may be a bit late to ask,
but are you sure you want to come?
Of course!
You weren't kidding about the "late" part.
We have no idea what the situation is inside NGL.
There may very well be a swarm
of giant Chimera Ants already,
hunting humans down.
If that turns out to be the case,
my priority will be saving them.
So I may not be able to help you.
You must be able to protect yourselves.
If you want to come, that's the requirement.
Okay, got it.
We'll be fine.
And if I'm the one who's in danger,
you should escape without me.
Got it?
A pretty good haul.
But it's not even half the size of
what my squadron delivered...
My focus was quality.
And I wasn't competing against you.
Whatever.
Anyway, did you hear?
That turtle guy ran into human resistance.
Resistance?
Hmm,
those were probably guns.
Guns?
Put simply, it's a barrel that launches
metal projectiles called bullets
using the explosive force of gunpowder.
It's one of the most commonly
used human weapons.
No idea what you're talking about...
If you want the details, read books.
Books are wonderful.
You can learn about how these
human creatures think,
behave, and function as a society.
Can you answer my question, then?
Do humans have armies too?
Armies?
Yes, that was an army.
They belong to a military body
led by an authoritative figure,
much like ourselves!
Ah, I have another question.
They mentioned something about a name.
A name?
I can't blame you for not understanding.
Because it's a human idea
we do not make use of.
Put simply...
So it seems there are humans
capable of more than running and crying.
I don't know why that should surprise you.
Given how different you and I are,
it's only natural that individual humans
would have unique traits as well.
After all, their blood flows through us.
Assemble, squadron leaders!
Assemble, squadron leaders!
The Queen summons us.
Assemble, squadron leaders!
Do you get a headache when
the Queen calls to us?
Yeah, my ears start ringing.
It's too bad the Queen can't talk like we do.
I shall now begin preparations
for the King's birth.
Every day, provide me with fifty humans.
Yes, Majesty!
Your Majesty, may I ask a question?
Permitted. Speak.
Among the humans are soldiers like ourselves,
with weapons to use against us.
We must fortify our defenses,
in preparation for any potential attack.
I have a few ideas...
Would you care to hear them?
I shall let you decide your course.
I must focus entirely on my son.
Yes, and one more thing...
Would you allow us to have names?
What is a name?
It's like a code that can be
used to identify each of us.
Very well, do as you like.
I am truly grateful!
How peculiar.
They speak their minds and
request to use these names.
While bettering the race, they compete for glory,
leading to a stronger sense of individuality.
I suppose I am also peculiar to
find this change fascinating.
Perhaps I, too, have traces
of human blood within me.
Regardless, I feel quite confident now.
I can see you already, as though
recalling a memory from my past.
My King...
You shall stand atop this world!
Names... Quite amusing.
The King's three Royal Guards.
I shall name you myself.
What did you just decide?
Remember what Kite said before we left?
That we should escape without
him if he's in danger.
Yeah, I don't think it was a choice...
Yeah.
That's why neither of us said anything,
but I've been thinking.
Is it possible for Kite, who earned Ging's respect,
to be in that much danger?
You said that Ging had a reason for
bringing Kite and me together...
Yeah.
You're probably right.
I don't know the reason,
but I can't give up halfway,
no matter what's going on.
Otherwise, I'll disappoint Ging.
Of course, I could never forgive myself, either.
So I won't run away.
That's what I've decided.
Man,
you had this totally serious expression,
so I was expecting something big.
But it's just business as usual.
Huh? I thought about this a lot.
I even ran a bunch of mental simulations...
Think all you want, but you'll still be Gon.
If someone said you should abandon them,
you'd never do it.
You make it sound like I wasted
my time considering it.
Then what about you?
I'm a spontaneous guy, so I'd think
about it when the time comes.
You mean you might run away?
Depends.
I can't say until it actually happens.
Say for instance...
I can't tell you what I'd do in
a hypothetical situation.
I don't decide until it's time.
The airship carrying the group
heads for the Mitene Union,
still unaware of the cruel fate
that lies in wait for them...
Next time: No x Good x NGL.
Ready, start!
Does that mean the queen isn't her— hur hur...
And there's your outtake!
﻿Would you allow us to have names?
What is a name?
It's like a code that can be
used to identify each of us.
Names... Quite amusing.
The King's three Royal Guards.
I shall name you myself.
No x Good x NGL
Yorknew City
Mitene Union
Seeking the giant Chimera Ant,
Mitene Union:
NGL Autonomous Region
Republic of Rokario
Hass Republic
Republic of West Gorteau
Republic of East Gorteau
Kite's group has arrived in the Mitene Union.
NGL Autonomous Region        Republic of Rokario
Now, they travel from the Republic of Rokario
to the neighboring NGL Autonomous Region.
NGL, huh?
They believe living naturally is always better.
They may be weird for living there,
but you guys are weird for coming to visit, too.
No idea what's going on,
but I've already driven in about
ten similar groups today alone.
Ten groups?!
Yeah.
Then it sounds like we're
among the last to arrive.
They're probably other pro Hunter teams.
All looking for the giant insects?
Yeah, those veterans are good.
Somehow, they've managed
to obtain this information.
But are there really bugs
large enough to attack humans?
It defies common sense,
but that voice they heard over the transmitter...
M-Monsters...
Giant bugs!
It could be some other kind of organism.
NGL is one big nature reserve,
so it's said to be inhabited by many organisms
that haven't been reported in academic circles.
It wouldn't be strange if there are
insects that attack humans.
Even if there aren't any giant bugs,
this trip will be worth it if we can confirm the
existence of any unidentified organisms.
As a new Magical Beast Hunter,
I need to produce results.
Now that I'm here, I have
to accomplish something.
According to the scouts that
went out first thing this morning,
a new human village has been discovered
in sector MA18, in the southwest.
There are twelve houses,
with anywhere from twenty to sixty residents.
Hey, that's pretty big.
Guess there are still a few large villages left.
I thought we'd already cleaned out that area.
Then I will add this village to our
list of targets for the day.
Colt, could you make the trip?
Roger.
What's this, Peggy?
You aren't sending me?
Cheetu, I need you to go northwest,
as originally planned.
Zazan, you accompany him.
There aren't any large villages
left in the northwest.
Even if there were, there probably
aren't any strong, young humans.
It's more fun when I get to chase them around.
Cheetu!
We do not hunt for amusement.
We serve the Queen.
We need only capture the
requested number of humans.
I know that, Colt.
We'll get the job done.
Right, Zazan?
I'll fulfill the quota.
But I don't need you telling
me how to hunt my prey.
I'll do things my own way.
It's fun to hunt humans when
they're running around.
What did you say?
Well, there you go.
Let's go, Zazan.
Colt, don't get too worked up.
You'll have an easier time
if you learn to relax.
They dare do things their own way?
At this rate, their squadrons will fall apart!
While the use of names
is convenient for leading the troops,
we don't want to encourage too much individuality.
Their behavior could lead to
a breakdown in command.
We must take steps.
I agree that something must be done.
Meleoron and Yunju have yet to
show themselves at a war council.
Meleoron!
Stop hiding, and show yourself!
Just to be clear,
it isn't my fault Yunju is absent.
You were hiding because you
thought you'd be blamed?
You're supposed to be a squadron leader.
Where is Yunju? Why is he not here?
See? I'm the one getting yelled at.
That's why I didn't want to come out.
It's always my fault.
You're just as guilty for hiding the truth.
And further...
I'll talk!
It isn't like I wanted to cover for him or anything.
He's the one who ran off on
his own to hunt humans.
What? Toward which sector?
Was a new village discovered?
That's not it!
You remember the humans who fought back?
The ones who were armed with guns.
Yunju was
all worked up about making them his pets.
Come on! What are you doing?
I accidentally stepped on you.
You're supposed to entertain us more!
That's right!
Run for your lives!
Until you're dead.
This is the border with NGL.
Those two huge trees serve as
the checkpoint and embassy.
What's out here, in the middle of nowhere?
These people are all so weird.
Stay alert.
The Ants are a concern, but the NGL is
more than a nature-loving organization.
Got it.
What brings you here?
We're on a hunt.
A quarantined organism may
have invaded this country.
If you are pro Hunters,
then we cannot deny you entry.
Follow me.
You're using computers and machines.
This place isn't within NGL's borders.
This area is used for foreign relations
and information exchange.
Are there any facilities similar
to this within the country?
No, not a single one.
No machines of any kind are allowed inside NGL.
Naturally, visitors are also not allowed
to bring any inside.
Which means that you'll need
to remove all metallic,
petroleum, glass, or other
such goods on your person.
D-Does that include my glasses?
Yes.
If your clothes, belts, shoes, or
underwear contain any plastic,
chemicals, or metal, you must remove them.
That isn't funny.
You're telling us to strip naked?
Don't worry.
There is natural clothing for sale upstairs.
Also, if there are any bolts inside
your body, dental implants,
gold, silver, or silicon enhancements
that cannot be removed,
you will not be allowed to enter.
Shop
Only the five of us are left?
I want you to stand by in the closest town.
We'll return here within two
weeks and contact you.
Got it.
The checkpoint is over there.
There will be a physical exam and interview,
as well as metal, x-ray,
and ultrasound scanning.
The security is rather strict.
Some people have smuggled in guns by
hiding the parts inside their bodies.
It's common for people to hide cameras
or cell phones in their rectums.
Some people even trained animals
to bring them laptops once they were inside.
All of you are clean.
Thank you for your patience.
Please pass through.
Welcome to NGL.
Okay, let's begin the hunt.
Horse Rental
12000 per day
Any sightings of giant insects?
I haven't heard anything.
Even if there were any such creatures,
the citizens in this country wouldn't
make much of a fuss.
If we are attacked and killed by animals,
that is simply nature taking its course.
Anyway, we should follow the
coast and check the villages.
If we go through all of them
and nothing turns up,
it probably isn't in this country.
That's assuming those guys
were telling the truth.
They're still following us,
aren't they?
Yeah...
They claim to be here
in case we encounter unknown tribes and
require interpreters or intermediaries.
But they're obviously here to watch us.
Well, I never expected the people
here to be of any help.
My gut
tells me that it's here.
Don't move.
If you die, it won't be my fault.
A-A mere animal shouldn't order
a superior human around!
Mere animal? Superior human?
I don't understand...
How are you and I different?
Shut up!
Good grief...
Didn't your parents ever teach you
to answer a question when you're asked?
There's no hope for you, old-timer.
Try harder in your next life.
Now you've done it.
If you kill him, we aren't able to store him.
I can make meatballs to serve
to the Queen within the day.
People like him irritate me.
They don't know their place.
I prefer to see them running around in fear.
Yesterday, you shot one in
the back when they ran.
If you'd let me handle this, I could secure
our prey in a smarter fashion.
When you said, "Don't move,"
that was meant for me, right?
Giving your squadron leader an order, huh?
Don't get too cocky.
I'm forgiving, so I'll let it slide.
If you enjoy killing so much, you should
volunteer for the feeding squad.
No hope...
Damn that Yunju.
Shut up!
If you don't shut up, I'll eat you right here!
Rammot!
What are you doing?
What am I doing?
I'm transporting the food.
Isn't that obvious?
Be more selective with your prey!
How often do I have to repeat myself?
That human won't serve any purpose.
And we've already met our quota for the day.
You're wasting your time.
Then I'll eat it!
What?
It'll be eaten sooner or later, anyway.
This is an order, Rammot.
Damn.
Too many soldiers trying to do things their way.
Huh?
I don't see any problem.
I enjoy what I do.
You want to take this one?
I guess it's dead, so you can't.
Which squadron are you from?
Oh, Zazan...
That nasty woman.
You have my sympathy.
You could join Yunju's team.
I hear that they're allowed to
kill any humans they want.
If you take this as a gift,
they'll probably let you join on the spot.
What is this?
It's terrible...
Who did this?
A gun?
People are fighting with guns!
Who could it be?
Guns aren't allowed in NGL!
They're members of the NGL
underground that manufactures DÂ².
Huh?
I don't think these wounds
were inflicted by humans.
Does that mean...
I can't be certain yet...
But if the monster we seek
was responsible for this,
we won't be able to handle it
with our current members.
Th-There they are!
Monsters!
Ponzu! Balda! Pekuba!
Run on my signal.
Got it?
Rainbow!
Seven Spectrum Array
Red Arrow
Red Arrow!
Now!
No hope.
Over here!
Are you okay?
Yes...
Anyway, we should contact
the other pro Hunters.
Can you handle that, Ponzu?
Got it.
What? That's it?
No, there are more.
There sure are!
I can smell living humans!
What do we do, Zaikahal?
As the Chimera Ants continue their rampage,
they have cornered the country's shadowy ruler.
A storm brews in NGL.
And Gon's group is heading straight for it.
Next time: Evil x and x Terrible.
Gon, what's wrong?
Do you have a fever?
What? A crick in your back?
Terrible...
﻿What do we do, Zaikahal?
Evil x and x Terrible
His name is Gyro.
And he is the NGL's don in the shadows.
Gyro spent his first twelve years
in a construction camp.
By the time he said his first word,
he'd learned to lay bricks and mix concrete.
His father forced him to slave away...
until Gyro finally killed him and fled.
His father, who raised Gyro
alone, was a silent man.
When his father returned from work,
he drank cheap liquor by himself
until he went to bed.
He very rarely talked to Gyro,
who was on the upper bunk.
Thus, Gyro barely knew
how to speak before the age of seven.
When Gyro returned from work,
he was not permitted to leave his bed,
except when visiting the restroom.
He was allowed to relieve himself twice
a day, and only before 9 PM.
The bed's rotting wood creaked loudly
whenever he turned in his sleep.
His father hated that sound.
After his father once severely
beat him because of that noise,
Gyro learned to sleep without any motion.
He also learned to control his bladder at night,
keeping an empty liquor bottle
for when he couldn't hold it.
"Don't make trouble for others."
That was the one lesson his
silent father taught him.
From a young age, Gyro did
his best to adhere to it,
learning from his mistakes.
Since his father had never
bought him even one toy,
this lesson was his one and
only gift from his father.
Within his small world,
his father was essentially God.
And no matter how cruel his father could be,
Gyro continued to idolize him,
believing that his father needed him.
This belief stemmed from two facts...
When Gyro was five,
a terrible fever nearly killed him.
All night, his father stayed up,
replacing his towels with fresh ones.
And the other reason was...
that his father had never
once ordered him to leave.
Gyro was proud of these two facts.
"Idiot...
He hasn't kicked you out
because you bring in money!"
Though he had previously kept that
possibility locked away deep in his mind,
Gyro snapped when the older youth
insensitively brought it to light.
Regretting that he'd revealed his secret,
Gyro was furious with himself.
His pride wounded, rage overcame
him, and he attacked the youth.
The youth had always mocked the timid boy,
so when the boy fought back,
he went mad with anger,
to the point where not even
knocking him out would satisfy him.
He stomped on the boy's face,
spat on him, and uttered the finishing blow:
"When you were sick, a neighbor took care of you!
Your old man was drinking by himself as always.
You were delirious, so you wouldn't know this.
But that night, the neighbor had
a fight with your old man.
He asked your dad what he'd do if his kid died.
Let me tell you what your old man said.
It wouldn't matter.
I don't care if he dies.
You hear that?"
As Gyro listened to the youth,
he witnessed something inconceivable.
His father looked him in the eye,
paid him no attention, and then left.
That was when Gyro finally understood.
The universe doesn't give a damn about me.
My father doesn't care if I live or die.
In other words, my life has no meaning.
If I live, I'll bring in money.
If I die, I'll just free up a little space. That's all.
My father told me not to
make trouble for others
so as to avoid any inconvenience for himself.
It was never a lesson to help his son.
It was fully for his own benefit.
In that lesson, "others" meant my father.
No...
It meant "humans."
Don't make trouble for humans.
I must not be human...
Eventually, the boy stood up,
grabbing a nearby hammer.
Nine years later, Gyro founded the NGL.
Nine years after that, NGL became
a nation, with him as its king.
Gyro desired to ruin life for the entire world.
The drug D² was merely the first step.
Yunju!
You handed those humans over to Colt so easily.
I didn't feel like fighting.
Either way, the food will reach the Queen.
I just want to enjoy the hunt.
Gyro...
Damn, I should have just eaten him!
Listen up!
I'm taking over this factory!
From today on, this is my fortress!
This is awesome!
This is bad.
These creatures are too dangerous!
Look!
What...
What is happening in this place?
What? More dead soldiers found?
Yeah, three of Zazan's were discovered.
Plus, one of mine is missing...
Its communication has been cut
off, and it hasn't returned.
Yunju's team dealt with the
humans holding guns.
Does this mean there are other
humans who are resisting us?
Sounds that way...
But the dead soldiers were killed
by something that wasn't a gun.
Something?
What could it have been?
How would I know?
Probably some new weapon we haven't seen.
Where are the corpses?
Peggy's examining them above.
This one was killed by a gun.
I'm sure since bullets are still inside the body.
But I'm not sure about the others.
The skull was punctured.
Yes, but not by a gun.
And I had difficulty understanding
the soldiers' explanation of the events...
As it is, the foot soldiers' communications
are simplistic and just to the point.
They said one human mimicked firing
a gun, and no projectile emerged,
but something pierced the
soldier's skulls and they fell, dead.
Can't some soldiers both see
and feel what's happening?
You're correct.
Those soldiers said that they
felt a projectile being fired.
So they possess abilities that we do not...
These humans could prove tougher
opponents than anticipated.
If humans have this power, once we
inherit their genes, we also will.
We only lack the trait.
You don't understand...
The humans' strength lies
in their ability to learn.
If they learn that the Queen
is where we're vulnerable,
they'll do whatever it takes to kill her.
Hmm?
You're the one who doesn't understand!
That just means we need to do
whatever it takes to keep her safe.
Am I wrong?
No, you're correct...
That's right.
I will protect her...
I will protect Reina!
Reina?
Who's Reina?
Uh, you're the one who said that name!
I did?
I didn't say anything.
You must be hearing things.
Anyway,
the problem is that humans
possess multiple weapons
capable of defeating our foot soldiers.
What should we do?
Use their weapons against them.
Give them a taste of their own medicine.
Only soldiers of our rank have the capacity
to manipulate complex weaponry.
But the humans don't know that.
They must be very frightened.
I understand...
You're a better strategist than I am.
Reina?
It didn't work...
No one received the message.
That means all the other Hunters I was
in contact with have been taken out.
Oh...
We should leave.
Those creatures are too much for us to handle.
We need to leave NGL and tell
the world what's happening...
So that an extermination force can be formed.
Whatever... Let's just run for it!
Or we'll all be—
I-It's here!
Run!
More will be coming!
Hold on, now...
I said to capture the humans alive.
We're supposed to deliver
them to the Queen fresh.
A-A human face...
What is that thing?!
Fire...
Open fire!
Orange Arrow
He grabbed my Orange Arrow,
fastest of my Rainbow Arrows, with ease.
Huh? This is clearly visible.
The grunts couldn't see this?
So the life energy
that surrounds your body is
what fuels this weapon?
You will make a magnificent
meal for the Queen...
Balda!
O-Oh, no!
I took a bite without thinking...
Zazan-sama will be angry again!
You bastard!
O-One moment...
My hands are full.
Take this!
As always, you're a disgrace in battle.
Zazan-sama...
Why don't you just drop what's in your hands?
Oh!
You're right.
We're going back.
Hmm?
Since we've obtained some excellent food.
He probably has the nutritional value
of a thousand normal humans.
Well done, Pike.
Zazan-sama!
I am most grateful for your praise...
You honor me!
Don't forget the food.
Oh, yes...
I can't save him myself...
I have to call for help!
There's still... There's still time!
Even if they take him, they
won't eat him immediately...
Please...
Find a Hunter with a strong aura!
I must hurry back to the border!
Other Hunters should be there—
So much fun...
Hunting is so much fun!
Help!!
Help!!
Chimera Ant Nest
Rocky Area
Notify the Hunter Association!!
It'll be dangerous.
But could you accompany me?
Of course.
We're pros.
Miss interpreter...
Sorry, but we're in a hurry.
Yes.
The horses can move a bit faster.
They won't be fast enough.
I want you two to return to
the border, find the others,
and get word to the Association.
These creatures are dangerous.
Got it.
Be careful, Kite.
Right.
If you can't keep up, I'll leave you behind.
Right back at you.
All ready to go!
Let's go.
This is a bullet casing.
Nothing mechanical is allowed here, right?
So the underground rulers of NGL
were manufacturing guns in addition to drugs.
But judging by this...
It wasn't done by a human.
Most likely, it was a Chimera Ant.
If the Chimera Ants are using guns...
I hate to consider the possibility,
but it's possible that NGL's underground rulers
have already been fed to the queen...
What will happen if Chimera Ants
are born with their genes?
NGL and Chimera Ants...
The worst combination imaginable.
This could create an unprecedented biohazard.
The situation has taken a sudden
turn for the absolute worst.
Next time: The x Fight x Begins.
Ready...
Set...
Gon!
﻿This is a bullet casing.
Nothing mechanical is allowed here, right?
So the underground rulers of NGL
were manufacturing guns in addition to drugs.
But judging by this...
It wasn't done by a human.
Most likely, it was a Chimera Ant.
The x Fight x Begins
The Chimera Ants continue their
rampage throughout NGL.
And they've finally struck against the don
who ruled this country from the shadows.
It's safe to assume that the Chimera Ants
have assumed control of NGL's interior.
The question is if we can reach their nest
before the Queen births the King.
More!
More!
I need much more.
I need more food of high
nutritional value for my child.
Over a hundred a day?
Yes, the Queen has requested
more food, to aid the King's growth.
We've been providing fifty a day.
Just when we'd managed
to assemble enough soldiers to ease the job...
If the Queen commands,
we will double or triple our quota.
We should increase our ranks...
No.
Increasing them would be simple, but it
would disturb the chain of command.
We must start by instilling more discipline.
We'll increase our ranks afterwards.
First, we must eliminate sedition in all—
Don't make me laugh!
That isn't going to be necessary.
The rare human I captured has the
nutritional value of a thousand normal ones.
One with the value of a thousand?
What are you talking about?
You didn't know?
I'm saying that some unique humans
are overflowing with life energy.
They're hard to find, which is why they're rare.
Rare?
These special humans each have the
nutritional value of a thousand normal ones?
That's right.
Impossible!
No such human could—
They do exist...
I saw and fought one.
And then, I accidentally took a bite!
Pike!
The one you took a bite out of wasn't rare.
Oh, yeah.
You're right.
Don't spout nonsense!
Your words were also nonsense, Zazan-sama.
I spoke nonsense? When?
You weren't the one who
captured the rare human.
I did.
Remember how you praised me
for the wonderful job I did?
I'm the one who disabled him!
But I'm the one who held him in place—
Enough.
Make yourself scarce.
F-For...
Forgive me!
Was that story true?
Wh-Why, if it isn't Bihorn-sama...
Yes, there really was a rare human.
Not that!
Did you really take a bite?
No, I took a bite of the normal
human, not of the rare—
It doesn't matter if it was rare or not.
Consuming the Queen's food
is not permitted.
I'll never do it again,
so please spare me just this once, Bihorn-sama!
Hold it! Come back here!
Bihorn.
Have you ever seen a rare human?
No, I've only heard about them from Zazan.
Zazan,
could you provide more detail
about this rare human?
Sure.
Arrows of light...
I understand.
That explains the hole in the skull of that grunt.
Yes, that must be it.
One mystery has been solved.
While the arrows are invisible to foot soldiers,
an officer like Pike can see them.
See them and stop them.
In other words, officers can capture them.
Yes, like I did.
That one was clearly different from
the other humans we've captured.
Its whole body appeared to
be shining with life energy.
That's how I knew
that it would have the nutritional
value of over a thousand humans.
More than ten days' worth in one human?
If that's true, we're saved.
It'd be far easier than carrying
a hundred humans around each day.
If we find one on the first day,
we can rest the next nine.
Fool!
They're rare because they're hard to find!
What? Again?
Understood.
Is something wrong?
Rammot is acting without my permission again.
Damn!
Why am I stuck eating horses?
Damn...
This is all Colt's fault.
I want to eat humans!
First, I have to deal with Rammot.
Otherwise, it sets a bad example.
What is this presence?
Could it be?
No one's here.
Say...
Something smells.
Coming from over there.
It's like a morning sacrifice.
A ritual practiced by birds
called bull-headed shrikes.
They impale their prey on sharp
objects, such as branches.
Hey!
Wha?
Wh-What is that?
They're capable of concealing their presence?
Trash.
Those are mine!
Ow!
This guy is strong.
Fighting him won't be easy.
Gon... Killua...
You two must deal with him yourselves.
That is a Chimera Ant soldier.
We will encounter many more like him.
I won't be able to help you during combat.
If you can't defeat it, you'll have to leave.
You'll just be in my way.
Weren't you listening, Kite?
We are also pros!
Don't treat us like kids!
What trick is this?
Suddenly, they feel far stronger.
Time to test it!
Thunderbolt
Thunderbolt!
First comes rock...
Rock...
Paper...
Rock!
Yes! Just enough!
Bastards!
I'm gonna eat you!
I will! Remember this!
Our attacks...
They didn't work.
That guy's smart.
He let his soldier do the fighting,
so he could learn our abilities.
Are you coming?
There's no need to feel down.
Your attacks weren't that bad.
You just need experience now.
If you wish to become stronger,
this is a perfect opportunity.
But if you aren't prepared, you won't
be able to endure the ordeal.
Whether we win or lose,
hell lies ahead of us.
We're coming.
Yeah.
That hurts...
Damn...
Don't lay a finger on them.
I'm gonna get my revenge.
I'll kill them...
I'll eat them all!
I'm willing to let you kill them.
But you may not eat them.
Bodies brimming with so much life
energy provide the finest nutrition.
They must be fed to the Queen.
No way! Killing them won't be enough!
I have to tear them to shreds,
fill my belly with them...
Crap on their skulls, and crush them!
And even still...
That still may not be enough to quell my fury!
I won't be satisfied with just killing them!
Don't get above yourself.
This is an order.
You would defy your leader's command?
It isn't just Yunju's team.
The other teams do it all the time.
Cheetu and Hagya's teams
do whatever they want.
Their leaders enjoy the hunt!
Is that true?
Yeah!
They chase humans, kill them,
then leave the dead bodies there.
None of the other squadrons just haul
bodies back like industrious little drones,
my dear leader Colt.
I'll transfer to a different squad if
that's what it takes to kill them.
Damn, it hurts!
A reason?
Because it's fun, of course.
It's good that humans know how to speak.
That way, we know what
they think as they die.
I enjoy seeing the fear on their faces.
Yep, it's great!
Once you've tried it, you can never go back.
Do you feel the same way, Cheetu?
You're wrong about one thing...
Hagya's and my teams are meeting our quota.
We use our free time to enjoy the hunt.
However...
You shouldn't waste the Queen's
precious food for sport.
Precious food?
Don't make me laugh.
There are more of them than she'll ever need.
They're trash!
I'm just taking out the trash.
Got a problem with that?
Not at all!
Do you know about the rare humans?
Rare humans?
Oh...
The ones that are overflowing with life energy?
I haven't seen one yet.
If you do, capture it alive and bring it back.
Fine.
I'll give the rare ones to the Queen.
Let that Rammot guy know, so he calms down.
I'll take that as a promise.
Fool. You think I'd keep that promise?
Let's find a rare one and eat it.
Let's eat!
How's Rammot doing?
Tonight will be critical.
But his anger and stamina
should see him through it.
Still, our army seems to have
too much personality.
Having multiple perspectives helps,
but too many are self-centered.
We're meeting our quota, so there's
nothing to worry about.
You're one to talk.
Are you counting the humans you capture?
Hmm... Kind of.
That doesn't count.
Perhaps we should have everyone
assemble to discuss this.
No, we operate at different times now.
Assembling everyone is impossible.
I'll talk to each leader and devise a solution.
What about the Queen?
She's busy nourishing the King.
We can't distract her.
I'll handle this.
Sounds tough.
Don't ruin your health.
If you're honestly concerned,
try to control yourself.
This is ugly...
The stench alone would guide us to the corpses.
Look at this.
So this is the hidden side of NGL.
I suppose so.
Killua... Kite...
The silence of the drug factory
overtaken by the Chimera Ants
further intensifies the chill in the air.
What awaits Gon and his friends there?
Next time: Kite x And x Slots.
Start the slots!
﻿You didn't know?
I'm saying that some unique humans
are overflowing with life energy.
They're hard to find, which is why they're rare.
Rare?
What trick is this?
Suddenly, they feel far stronger.
Thunderbolt!
Thunderbolt
First comes rock...
Rock...
Paper...
Rock!
If you wish to become stronger,
this is a perfect opportunity.
But if you aren't prepared, you won't
be able to endure the ordeal.
Whether we win or lose,
hell lies ahead of us.
Kite x And x Slots
Kite, Gon, and Killua have advanced
deep within NGL, in search
of the Chimera Ant nest,
and have arrived at a cliff
with peculiar openings.
This is the Chimera Ant nest?
No.
They don't make their nests in holes.
They use mud and feces to build them.
Let's go.
You'll understand once we're inside.
There's no telling when or
from where they will attack.
Be on your guard.
Yeah, got it.
That other Chimera Ant
completely concealed his presence.
Yeah.
Let's go.
Is this place...
Yes, it is NGL's hidden side.
A drug factory.
Exactly.
This factory produces the ingestible drug D²,
which is spreading throughout the mainland.
There are probably nearby bila trees,
which produce its main ingredient.
Ironic given their claims as preservationists.
They're making more than drugs.
Look.
It's the same as the others.
I assume that only the NGL leaders
know the truth of this place.
The other members
joined because they honestly loved nature.
So this facility is the center
of NGL's underground.
If it's empty...
Then Chimera Ants have wiped
out the NGL underground.
And a bunch of amateurs with guns
won't suffice to deal with them.
What about their boss?
He either escaped or was eaten.
Either way, it's bad news.
Huh? What do you mean?
Shh!
A few are around.
They're slowly approaching
through the middle tunnel.
There are more in the left and right tunnels.
En...
How far away can you search?
Everything within a forty-five meter radius.
F-Forty-five meters?
Depending on physical and mental condition,
I can increase that by a few meters.
Here they come.
Keep it down, you two.
Who are you guys?
How dare you intrude on my turf?
Help... Please help us!
Stop talking, Spot!
You're just a damned dog!
Oops, didn't mean to do that.
Oh, well.
I'm getting bored with these guys.
Guess I'll get rid of Rover, too.
When you beg like that,
I just want to kill you more.
Stop!
Kite...
Don't move carelessly.
There's more than one enemy.
They want you to rush over.
Bye-bye.
H-Hel—
Don't look away.
If they shoot a projectile your way,
you won't be able to see it.
I've got it.
You three will be my new dogs.
Chimera Ants have always been aggressive,
but it seems consuming malicious humans
has made them even more evil.
Huh? What do you mean?
Phagogenesis.
If we don't deal with them here,
many more will die!
Capture them!
I'll take the one in back.
You boys will have to deal
with the two rushing us.
Right!
Got it.
Do not hesitate.
You must fight to kill.
Bring it!
Ha, take this.
My unblockable Thousand Punches!
That was close.
You have more power than I expected.
These guys are really tough.
They have the hard shells of insects,
combined with human agility...
What's on your mind now?
He's right.
I can't hesitate!
First comes rock...
What?
Little boy, do you want your new
name to be Spot or Rover?
Don't hesitate to kill.
You'll be roving around the land of the
dead in no time, so I'll call you Rover!
Been a while since I flipped my switch on.
Snake Awakens
Damn you!
Curse you!
Take this!
Fool!
This is the poisonous one!
Well?
How does it feel as the poison
spreads through your body?
Does it feel good?
Very effective.
Once I drug him enough,
we'll have a human dog.
Are you done over there?
Oh, not yet?
How...
My body is immune to poison.
Ah, I see.
If you behave, I'll kill you fast.
Oh, well...
It just means that I was weaker.
She let that cheap act fool her.
What is this power flowing from his body?
Any closer, and I'll suffer considerable damage.
But...
What's wrong?
Are you getting scared?
If I don't attack, Yunju will kill me!
The source of his power
is his fist!
He's preparing to launch an attack many...
No, dozens of times stronger than the last.
Or will he fake the punch and use a kick?
No, he's definitely going to use his fist.
Then I have no choice.
I'll sacrifice my eight left
legs to block his punch,
while using the right eight to grab him.
Then I can bite him and inject my venom!
Let's run a simulation...
This will work!
It's just a punch.
No matter how strong it is,
if I'm prepared, I can take it!
Hey, we should get started soon.
Wait a little longer.
Screw that!
You don't have a choice in the matter.
Now, entertain me.
Very well...
What...
Why are you here?
This is my castle.
A king needs no reason to be in his castle.
There are many drugs here
that emit strong odors.
I would expect you to avoid this place.
Shut up... I like this place!
What happened to the head of NGL?
He would have been here.
Beats me!
He's probably inside the Queen's belly.
I'm going to build my own kingdom starting here.
Then I'll take control of the whole world.
That will be impossible for a
boor who amuses himself
by making dogs of humans.
Really now?
I can't wait to strip you down and
put a collar around your neck!
Damn!
Huh?
Hey! Get down here!
You only summon me when you're in trouble.
You'd better watch it.
I don't have time for small talk.
Hurry it up.
Oh, really?
You're so impatient.
Are you insulting me?
Forget about turning you into a dog!
I'm gonna kill you!
4!
Four, huh?
Damn, bad spin.
What was that?
I have no bad spins, bastard!
Die!
I'll pretend to attack,
while I block his punch.
Then I grab him and bite.
Here I go!
Rock... Paper...
Just as I thought!
Block!
Scissors!
What?
A-A sword?
Impossible...
Where was he hiding that?
But this could be perfect.
I can pretend I've been defeated,
then wait for an opening to bite him!
You can't relax after dismembering them.
The head and body can survive
an entire day after they've been separated.
You must crush the head.
And preferably, you'll kill
them quickly and quietly.
Oh, it's him!
The thing that shot us.
I got a slot machine in my mouth!
It goes from 1 to 9.
Each number summons a different weapon.
This is my Crazy Slot!
Don't forget the name!
Just go away.
That's a strange power...
It talks by itself?
Apparently.
If it uses a slot machine,
doesn't that mean you can't
choose your weapon?
Yes, and I cannot
change or get rid of the
weapon I receive until I use it.
It's very aggravating.
In that case...
Why did you come up with this power?
We've lost the signal from Yunju's team.
Were they killed?
The signal indicated three enemies,
and that they looked tastier than the others.
They must be rare humans.
And we have cause to fight.
Isn't Yunju using that factory as a base?
So the rare humans should
still be near the factory.
Let's go! Tonight, we feast!
Feast!
Both of your powers are much
easier to use than mine.
Compared to that thing of yours? No kidding.
Yeah.
Gon, you appear to have incorporated
Enhancer, Transmuter, and Emitter
abilities into your Rock-Paper-Scissors.
Yep, but my natural affinity
lies with Enhancer abilities.
Killua used lightning.
Are you a Transmuter?
Yeah, but it's not that strong,
and I lose energy fast.
You'll have the chance to improve.
Let's hurry.
The nest is close.
I don't get it...
I can feel power rushing into me.
My body is overflowing with energy!
What is this?!
What's wrong?
A signal from one of my soldiers.
Rammot is acting strangely.
Rammot?
Well?
Look at this!
I feel reborn!
Can you see that light, Peggy?
What tremendous life energy...
A Chimera Ant has finally
discovered the power of Nen.
Next time: Inspiration x To x Evolve.
I want inspiration to evolve!
When will you evolve?
Now!
﻿Been a while since I flipped my switch on.
Scissors!
Well?
Look at this!
I feel reborn!
Inspiration x To x Evolve
The Hunters Association
has learned of the Chimera Ants
from the biological survey team,
and now awaits the world leaders'
decision on how to handle them.
We're counting on you.
You have a single mission.
The immediate extermination
of these dangerous creatures.
There have already been many casualties.
We will use any means necessary.
Will that be acceptable?
Naturally, we have no intention of
telling the experts how to proceed.
We simply desire
those dangerous creatures
eradicated as swiftly as possible.
Understood.
So their goal is to eradicate the Ants,
leaving the Hunters Association
to take the blame.
Th-The Chimera Ants
have five ranks, w-with the Queen at the top.
Queen
There's the Queen.
Royal Guard
Under her is the Royal Guard,
Squadron Leaders
and then, the Squadron Leaders.
Under the Squadron Leaders are Captains,
and they oversee many foot
soldiers and other grunts.
A-And once the King is born,
the hierarchy shifts like so.
The Royal Guard that followed the Queen
switches into the King's service.
A-Afterwards, Squadron Leaders
report directly to the Queen,
and she focuses on directing the soldiers.
The Queen remains in the castle,
periodically giving birth to Kings.
The Kings travel and mate
with different organisms,
so as to breed new Queens.
That explains their fast reproduction rate.
To prevent a Chimera Ant population explosion,
you must defeat the Queen before
she can give birth to a King.
But first, you need to defeat
all the soldiers guarding her.
That's a tall order.
Got it. We'll be waiting.
The punitive force's first wave is on its way.
Punitive force?
I wonder who they'll send.
They'll be facing those vicious Chimera Ants.
They'll be strong.
They'd better be!
I'm worried about Kite and the kids.
They'll arrive in three days.
How?
Look at this!
Isn't it incredible?
Why does Rammot have so much life energy?
There must have been some catalyst.
A catalyst...
Rock...
Paper...
Rock!
That hurts...
Damn...
What if their attacks were the catalyst?
I can feel the power filling me!
Peggy...
I told you that we are capable
of anything that humans are.
Including the use of this strange power?
But this is...
Rammot, while you have that power, hit me.
Wh-What are you saying?
You've been ticking me off,
so I won't go easy on you.
I'm assuming that's what it takes.
Then I won't hold back.
Come.
Colt!
This is a message from Hagya.
This is a message from Hagya.
The ultimate prey is either
within the factory or nearby.
Capture it.
Capture it...
Dead or alive.
Capture it!
Hagya-sama...
What is it?
Do you believe they will succeed?
There are enough Captains for a decent fight.
For a decent fight, huh?
But I doubt they'll be much help.
I'm fine with that.
Why is that?
They're just buying time for us to arrive.
Oh, I see.
Then the rare humans will be ours to take.
Exactly.
We're surrounded.
Their numbers are great.
Now, then...
Let's decide order and methodology.
As for our targets, you have three choices.
One...
Decide the order in which you will fight.
Two, attempt to escape.
Three, give up and let us capture you.
If you choose option one,
you will fight one-on-one battles with us
for a chance to survive.
I don't recommend the second option.
You'll anger us, resulting in a brutal capture
and prolonged suffering for all of you.
Option three is out of the question.
That would anger us even more than option two.
So, what will you do?
Kite...
We couldn't have asked for a better deal.
One-on-one fights with their Captains.
We'll start with whoever is prepared to fight.
I'll go.
No, I will.
First comes rock!
Rock, paper, scissors!
Okay, I'm first!
While the Ants have inherited
individualism from humans,
they've lost the unity that's
characteristic of ants.
I hope we'll be able
to take advantage of that change.
Well, we need to decide who
to send from our side.
#6...
#6!
Who's #6?
Lucky me!
Baro?
How will the victor be decided?
Eh? That should be obvious.
Whoever dies first loses.
We can't just surrender?
What?!
Are you crazy?
If you lose, we'll feed you to the Queen.
If you don't defeat me,
you're guaranteed to die!
Yeah, I'm okay with that.
But there's no need for you to die.
If I beat you, I won't want to eat you.
If you surrender, you'll live.
But if you lose,
you must promise never to eat another human.
This guy isn't taking us seriously!
He has more pep than any human I've seen!
Lucky you, Baro-chan!
I'll kill you!
You managed to dodge that one.
Then how about this?
The same attack?
Gon!
He altered course.
I'm fine.
Why are you so tough?
By this point, the rest were vomiting organs.
Whatever...
Just need a few more times.
There's no way to dodge my homing roll!
Indeed...
He only has to alter his course to
match the direction Gon dodges.
What will you do, Gon?
Kid, I have something to
tell you before I kill you.
The main reason we kill humans isn't to eat them
or to feed them to the Queen.
Then why?
Because it's fun!
I love the sound as humans
vomit their own organs
with a plop!
It's hilarious because it looks like barf.
That isn't funny.
I'll make you vomit your own
organs with a plop, too!
He didn't dodge...
But stopped him.
Compared to Razor's spikes,
this is nothing!
Well, we're in a hurry.
Who's my opponent?
Hey!
#3.
#3's up!
You won't be smiling for long.
I'm about to show you hell.
Got it?
I'm nothing like the trash over there.
Trash?
Huh? I said trash because he's trash.
I'm ten times stronger than that guy.
Oh, that's nothing to brag about.
What was that?!
When they enter battle,
their aura becomes much stronger.
They're at their best in battle.
Gon tends to have an agitatingly slow start,
but we should have time.
We'll reach the Queen before
she gives birth to the King.
But why
do I have such a bad feeling?
I feel like I'm missing something.
There's a gnawing anxiety that won't go away.
Look, Peggy!
I can freely control this energy!
This is incredible!
We should do more research.
Eh?
If we learn the proper way
to wield this power,
we can synchronize it with our natural abilities
to make it an even stronger weapon.
You're too retentive...
Zazan...
She said she captured a rare
human a few days ago...
If we're lucky,
he's still in the storeroom.
Find and secure him.
My entire body is covered by hardened skin.
I can take as many of those
attacks as you can throw!
Oh, yeah?
Is there anyone ten times
stronger than this guy?
This is a pleasant surprise.
Their Captains can be dispatched easily enough.
Am I worried over nothing?
That's enough... It's my turn!
2!
What?
Two, huh?
Damn, bad spin.
Killua...
That scythe is nasty.
Gon, Killua...
In three seconds, jump up.
Wh-What is this overwhelming pressure?
Right!
I've experienced this sensation before!
Silent Waltz: Grim Reaper's Dance
I remember now.
This is
death!
Murder via overwhelming force.
Get lost.
This scythe can be used
only with this technique.
And it won't disappear until I've used it.
It's such a drag...
So why did you choose that power?
Be cautious as we advance.
As I mentioned, that won't be
enough to kill them immediately.
Are you okay?
It's only getting worse from here.
If you start to sympathize with the enemy,
you won't be able to handle what's coming.
I'm fine.
I have no sympathy for bugs
that call each other trash.
That's a dangerous view.
What would you do if one of those
bugs cared for its comrades?
Kite, Gon, and Killua head toward
the Chimera Ant Queen's castle
to prevent the King's birth.
Next time: A x Fated x Awakening.
I'll go.
No, I will!
No, me!
Then I'll go.
Go right ahead.
﻿I have a bad feeling.
I feel like I'm missing something.
There's a gnawing anxiety that won't go away.
A x Fated x Awakening
Kite, Gon, and Killua have
taken care of Hagya's soldiers.
As they head deeper into NGL in
search of the Chimera Ants' nest,
within the Queen's castle,
one of the soon-to-be-born
King's three Royal Guards
is about to awaken.
What kind of magic did they use?
Wow, all of them were split cleanly in half.
Impressive.
This one almost looks like he was smashed
by a rock, or some other hard object.
And Baro's the one with an iron shell.
So this is the rare humans' power.
Are you worried now?
The king of the jungle's blood
runs through my veins.
A few humans can't scare me.
Of course...
Whew, that's a relief.
I thought I was gonna miss out on tonight's feast.
These must be extremely rare humans.
We'll tear them to shreds and gobble them down!
We're being followed.
Not from there.
There's quite a number of them.
Listen up...
Your job is to distract the enemy,
while attacking from a distance.
Do not get too close.
The 2nd Platoon will take the right,
as the 3rd Platoon pincers
them from the left.
My 1st Platoon will trap them,
preventing a rear retreat.
Go!
Gon and I didn't notice them.
They're coming from the left and the right.
Keep up your guard.
Damn...
The trees are getting in the way.
Yeah.
Shouldn't we get out of the forest?
This is a trap.
Okay, keep up the chase.
Hagya-sama, all goes according to plan.
Good work, Flutter.
Once we drive our prey into range,
one strike with my fangs will finish them.
This doesn't feel right...
Eh?
You ordered Flutter to chase the prey,
while you hid in the grass to ambush them.
That's pretty lame.
Huh?
Aren't you the king of the jungle?
A king should face his prey, rather than hiding.
Just jump out and go,
"Roar! Chomp! Ga ha ha ha!"
That's so much cooler.
But you know...
This is how the king of the jungle hunts.
Shut up and watch!
Yeah, yeah.
Well, I don't care, so long as I
get to eat the rare humans.
Rare human?
What's that?
I'll explain the details later.
Its number is 4-933.
It was captured and brought
in by Zazan's squadron.
Number 4-933...
Doesn't mean a thing to me.
It was probably given to the Queen.
Her appetite is even more insatiable these days.
She'll give birth to an incredible king.
Don't see 'em.
It must already be inside the Queen's belly.
Are you certain?
It isn't here...
Where else would it be?
Could it have escaped?
Any creature poisoned by our nerve toxin
will be paralyzed for at least a month.
After a mere three days, it couldn't move around.
You can't be sure when it
concerns the rare ones.
They aren't like normal humans.
You should know that very well.
I'm not the same creature I was before.
The next time I see them,
I'll crush them, rip them apart, and eat them.
The antidote I hid in my
back tooth came in handy.
But I could barely drag myself across the ground.
For the time being, I'll have to hide here...
But what's going on?
How can a Chimera Ant use Nen?
Could you check once more?
Come on, give me a break...
I'm busy enough as it is.
Didn't you hear me say the Queen
has a huge appetite now?
I am well aware of that.
I don't know anything about this "rare" stuff,
but why are you so obsessed with this human?
I'd like to ask it a few questions.
Can't you see the light surrounding his body?
Light?
No, I don't see a thing.
I see.
Then it's true that only some
can identify this power.
Meaning it's a talent.
Exactly.
This talent is my destiny, bestowed
upon me by the heavens.
The power of a chosen few...
If I master this power, I can become the king!
I will be king!
Retreat! Retreat!
Hmm? What's wrong, Flutter?
Wh-What's that?
He's gorgeous!
We're leaving.
Huh?
What about the feast?
He was able to understand
that he was outclassed,
and he calmly backed down at once.
Most likely, he was a Squadron Leader.
I always believed that the world
revolved around my claws and fangs.
That if I brandished them,
I could take the life of any other creature,
could always satisfy my own hunger...
And that I was truly blessed.
However, that wasn't the case.
Others were stronger,
so I never could have ruled.
Death taught me that lesson.
But I am stronger now.
At the moment, we may not be
strong enough to defeat them.
But now we are armed with the ability to learn.
We're following them.
Their nest must be nearby.
If we follow them,
we will find the Queen.
What is that?
Something is coming!
That was a fascinating conversation...
You mentioned something about talent.
Allow me to take part.
O-One of the Queen's Royal Guards!
If I master this power, I can become the king!
I will be the king!
A short and foolish dream...
I am totally outclassed.
I can never escape the position
I've been born into...
You can relax.
Let's talk over there.
Y-Yes!
This power is not for me...
But for this Royal Guard...
And for the King it serves!
This power is for serving them!
Impossible...
What is that
evil aura?
By the way...
Yes?
Why is a live human underneath those bones?
Hmm... Nyow I understand.
What are you researching?
I'm learning about those rare
humans you mentioned.
I've attempted to study them many times,
but it wasn't written in any books.
Asking one of them is faster
than flipping through books.
Wasn't that why you were looking for him?
Th-That's exactly right.
There we go.
Ah!
"New memories are stored
in the hippocampus,
while old memories are kept
in the cerebral cortex.
To invoke those memories..."
Nyow I understand.
Ah, you... Come over here.
Hatsu is a technique for
manipulating aura at will.
To summarize the categories of Nen users...
They are:
Enhancers,
Transmuters,
Conjurers,
Emitters,
Manipulators,
and Specialists,
for a total of six categories.
C-Categories...
Every Nen user belongs to one of these.
You want to increase the amount of your aura,
as well as the speed of its flow.
Most of your basic training will
be spent on these two tasks.
In a battle between Nen users,
those are the factors that...
That...
Th-that are pivotal
in determining the victor.
Nyow I understand...
In addition to the basic Nen
abilities Zetsu and Ren,
there are also unique techniques that reflect
the Nen user's individuality.
If you develop a technique that synchronizes
with your style and Nen category,
the manifestation of your ability has
a better chance of being stronger.
And how do you identify which
Nen category you belong to?
Water divination
is the simplest
and most commonly used method.
Water divination?
Give it a try, Rammot.
Right.
Since the water's overflowing,
that makes you an Enhancer.
An Enhancer?
Which confirms that Rammot is a Nen user?
Seems so.
Oh, yeah...
Didn't you say you fought a rare human?
Y-Yes.
The impact from its attack opened your pores...
And released your aura.
Pores?
Apparently, they're small holes all over your body.
If they're sealed, aura can't be released.
I see...
Colt also thought that Rammot's change
was triggered by his fight
with the rare humans.
It seems he was correct.
So if Rammot is a Nen user now,
can we use him to open everyone's pores?
Sure, sounds good.
I think I'll give this a try.
The leaf wilted...
Unbelievable.
One of us was born possessing Nen ability,
without having to fight a rare human!
Then, Commander, that makes you a Specialist,
not belonging to another category?
Neferpitou.
Huh?
That is the name the Queen gave me.
From now on, call me Neferpitou.
Right!
I don't need him anymore.
Feed him to the Queen now.
Right!
From birth, Neferpitou already
possessed incredible power.
This presence casts a dark shadow over the fates
of Gon and his friends.
Next time: Light x And x Darkness.
Wake up!
C'mon, it's morning.
It's 10:50.
I'll kill-you-a!
﻿Neferpitou.
Huh?
That is the name the Queen gave me.
From now on, call me Neferpitou.
Light x And x Darkness
Attention all Squadron Leaders and Captains...
Attention all Squadron Leaders and Captains.
Commander Neferpitou will hold
an award ceremony in auditorium one.
If you are able to endure considerable pain,
you will receive tremendous power in return.
That power is to be used for our Queen!
They're continuing to go straight.
The Chimera Ant nest must be up ahead.
Amazing...
He's been picking them up this entire time,
never losing them for an instant.
Kite said he could use En within
a radius of forty-five meters.
I've heard that those called Nen masters
can handle around fifty meters.
Kite is nearly there.
Actually, given that he's kept
it up for an entire night,
he's probably stronger.
Stronger than a master...
Then Kite's the real deal.
Yeah, he's the first real pro Hunter we've met.
Tsezgerra was a pro Hunter,
but we really only knew him
as another player in a game.
Bisky was an incredible Hunter.
But to us...
Yeah, she was our Nen mentor.
And the first to teach us about Nen...
Wing-san was our Nen master and savior.
Looking back,
we always meet the right people
just when we need them most.
And those people have all made us stronger.
Razor, too, huh?
Yeah.
It's clear that Ging really did create
Greed Island to train you.
And once you beat the game,
he deliberately led you to Kite.
Ging!
I'm not sure if Ging predicted what
would happen when we met Kite.
But he certainly knew
that you would like the man who
had earned Ging's respect.
And he knew without doubt
that you would go with Kite.
He wants us to get stronger by traveling with Kite.
This is a pretty brutal place for training, though.
That's why I keep asking if your resolve is firm.
As you mentioned,
Ging-san probably had certain
expectations when he sent you to me.
But I do not intend to train
you during this journey.
We don't have that kind of time.
I brought you along because I
thought you might be of use.
From here, it all comes down to your resolve.
If it's strong, you'll develop your Nen
and grow strong via combat.
If it's weak, the Ants will eat you.
But we can't die...
We are pro Hunters.
Those who call themselves
Hunters always get their prey.
For Hunters, that is the first commandment.
Those who call themselves Hunters
should always be on the hunt.
A hunt involves both hunter and prey.
It is a battle of resolve.
Emerging victorious from a battle of resolve
is what makes a successful hunt.
The loser has to follow the
winner's rules and customs.
Usually, this means the loser's death.
Rules...
If you don't want that result, then win.
Improving your Nen is important, of course.
But to be a successful Hunter, you must
understand your enemy and yourself.
Th-That's why...
That's why you hit me back then!
Fool!
Why would you try to enter Snake
Beech Forest in this season?!
Look!
That's a territorial marker
made by Foxbears with cubs.
Any animal seeing it knows to get far away!
That was the forest's rule and custom.
You taught me the rules in Ging's place.
Oh...
That's right... I just remembered.
A Hunter License?
What's this?
This is Ging-san's.
Huh? It's Ging's?
Do you remember what my final test was?
Yeah, to find Ging.
Before the test began, Ging-san gave this to me.
He said I should use it to find him...
I planned to return it to him once I did.
Huh? He wouldn't take it back?
No...
I completely forgot I had it.
Gon, you said that you're going to
find Ging-san on your own, right?
Huh?
Yeah.
Then you have to do it.
And would you return this for me?
Sure!
But first, I have to finish this job
with you and get a lot stronger.
After that, I'll find Ging and give this back.
I promise!
I'm counting on you.
Well,
let's get a move on before we lose the trail.
Take that!
Next!
Being average is terrible...
You have to go to all this trouble
just to unleash your power.
Peggy, I'll leave this to you.
Where are you going?
I want to find out how strong I really am.
That's a monster.
What is this?
I don't believe it!
What's wrong, Kite?
Gon, Killua...
Run!
Huh?
Hurry up!
Get out of here!
Found you...
Get away from me!
Malice
Idio—
Good decision, Killua.
Take Gon and run!
This time, you're in big trouble...
Let's see if you get a good roll!
3!
Ah, so you can do stuff like that?
We were overconfident...
The two of us were still weaker
than Kite who'd lost an arm.
That thing knew.
This is reality.
If Kite had been alone,
this probably wouldn't have happened.
We were fools!
Hey...
Look.
Huh? You left Kite behind?
Why?!
What happened?
Explain what's going on!
H-Hey, what are you doing?!
Yes, I understand.
Can you wait there a little longer?
We're headed your way right now.
We have reinforcements.
Chairman Netero.
What's this? They're just kids.
If you're here to play, you'll get burned.
Go back home.
Stop it, Morel-san.
That isn't nice...
They're only children.
You look pretty defeated.
Was the enemy that strong?
One of them could use Nen.
That was the worst aura I've ever encountered.
Worse than my brother's...
Worse than Hisoka's...
Now that I've learned Nen myself, I can tell.
You guys are unbelievably strong.
But I still can't see you defeating that thing...
Whenever humans encounter the unknown,
they tend to lose perspective.
Currently, you're experiencing a state of panic.
We'll take it from here, so go lie in bed.
You're no better than I am, Knov.
Kid...
The minute you start talking about who
can win in a Nen fight, you're wrong.
In most cases, you won't know
your opponent's abilities.
One instant of carelessness
is all it takes to turn the tables and cost a life.
You can't make assumptions based
on the amount of aura displayed.
The battle can turn at any point.
That's what fighting with Nen means.
But regardless,
you must always fight certain of victory.
That is a Nen user's spirit.
The moment you were overwhelmed
by the opponent's aura and fled,
you were disqualified.
You're lower than a loser!
Morel, that's enough.
Is Gon asleep?
He was going to attack the enemy,
so I used force to stop him.
I didn't have time to control my strength,
so I don't know when he'll wake up.
That kid shows some promise, then.
Morel!
It's difficult to believe that giant
Chimera Ants are eating humans,
but since it appears to be true,
we must keep casualties to a minimum.
If we send fighters who aren't strong enough,
they'll only strengthen the enemy.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
That's why there are only three.
A select few...
We're not
strong enough.
We sent two assassins to the nearest village.
It's your decision whether you want to fight.
But you must defeat them before you come.
If you wish to live as a Hunter...
We are not desperate for help.
We only seek the strong.
Will you fight!? Or not!?
The moment you were overwhelmed
by the opponent's aura and fled,
you were disqualified.
You're lower than a loser!
I am no longer qualified...
Killua...
Thanks.
Why would you thank me?
Weren't you the one who stopped me?
Had I lost control back there,
I would've gotten in Kite's way.
Then, all three of us could have died.
But I...
I let Kite die...
Kite is alive!
He wouldn't ever let that thing beat him!
But considering his injury,
he'd have a hard time moving around.
So he's probably hiding.
Waiting for us to return!
So we should hurry back...
Once we're stronger.
To save Kite!
Gon...
You are light.
Yeah, you're right.
Sometimes, you shine so
brightly, I must look away.
But even so, is it still okay
if I stay at your side?
Let's go.
To become stronger!
We welcome you anytime!!
Prepare a freezer in the castle.
We need one that can store
over a hundred humans.
To ensure that our collection doesn't rot.
Yep.
I think
I'm pretty strong.
Next time: Promise x and x Reunion.
It has to be Killua...
Stay asleep in the chair, man.
﻿Kite is alive!
He wouldn't ever let that thing beat him!
So we should hurry back...
Once we're stronger.
To save Kite!
Promise x and x Reunion
Gon and Killua have vowed to save Kite.
But before they can return to NGL,
they must pass the condition
set by Chairman Netero,
leader of the punitive force.
What are those?
Tokens.
You take a piece of marked wood and split it,
giving each half to a different person.
They work as proof that you're an ally
or to authenticate a document.
We sent two assassins to the nearest village.
In this case,
each of the two assassins
holds one matching token.
We defeat them and take the tokens.
It's been erased.
That means someone checked the board.
Yeah.
You must be Killua and Gon.
Nice to meet you.
My name is Palm.
It's a pleasure.
Oh, dear...
No need to be so tense.
I imagine the Chairman probably didn't provide many details.
Allow me to explain.
Why don't we have some tea?
I am a student of Knov-sensei.
He said I would only get in his way...
But I insisted on accompanying him.
Who's that?
She probably means one of the
guys with Chairman Netero.
Yes, the one wearing a black suit...
My teacher is an incredible person.
Cool, intelligent, composed...
Ah, composed and cool mean the same thing!
Oh, dear...
Oh, but I only respect him, that's all.
There's nothing romantic about my feelings...
At least, I may wish that were the case.
After all, when it comes to falling
in love, respect is a major factor.
Ah, my teacher knows nothing
about this, of course.
I haven't said a word to him,
and I don't intend to.
No one can say what will happen...
After all, love is a spontaneous thing,
don't you agree?
Uh, can I interrupt you?
Aren't we supposed to fight you?
Huh? Oh, dear...
Yes, I apologize.
The Chairman and my teacher
said I couldn't accompany them any farther.
But I insisted on going with them.
It feels like I spent a lifetime just trying
to convince them of my determination.
And finally, they relented, with one condition.
Uh, I'm asking about...
My teacher may appear a cold person,
but he's actually quite gentle.
But you have to spend a lot of
time with him to realize that.
Ah, by "spending time with him," I don't mean—
Okay! What's the condition?!
Knuckle and Shoot's defeat.
To think those vulgar, barbaric unmannered brats
will be allowed inside NGL before me...
I cannot allow that.
Palm-san, turn off your Hatsu!
She's an Enhancer like me.
I'm not too happy about that.
Knuckle and Shoot?
Not us?
That's right.
After all, I'm not the one who's
supposed to defeat Knuckle and Shoot.
You two are.
Knuckle and Shoot are Morel-san's students.
They, too, received a condition.
I don't know what that condition was...
But whether it's us or them, only one
group will be allowed into NGL.
The deadline is one month.
Since we were told to keep
these tokens for a month,
that means someone will come for them.
What do we do, Knuckle?
That's easy.
He who strikes first, wins!
Find 'em...
And kill 'em!
Certain Death
My name is Knuckle Bine!
I am a Beast Hunter!
I challenge the two punitive
force candidates to a duel!
Come tonight at midnight sharp, and face me!
Bring it on
I won't try to run or hide.
I won't bring any weapons or allies.
It'll just be me and me alone.
So come and fight me!
But where?
The location?
You have to tell them where to find you.
Bring it on
A man never turns his back on an enemy.
I'll follow you to the ends of the Earth...
You won't get away!
Even if he said where, I wouldn't go.
He's just a decoy.
His partner's probably hidden
somewhere, watching.
They're watching to see if
anyone reacts suspiciously.
According to Palm, they don't
even know our names.
Yeah.
So their goal must be to smoke us out.
No one's stupid enough to do all that for real.
Did he look strong?
He's pretty strong.
What will it take to defeat him?
I have no idea!
One of the Hunters with the Chairman said that
In a Nen battle, nothing is certain.
So, according to him,
it's wrong for me to judge if a fight can be won.
I disagree.
If you want to survive, you must
increase your odds of victory.
Gauging the strength differential between
you and an opponent is crucial.
If you're up against someone you can only beat
once or twice out of a
hundred times, don't bother.
You need at least a fifty-percent chance.
If possible, greater than
seventy percent is preferable.
To reach that, we must do two things...
Work on our fundamentals, and learn
more about our opponents' abilities.
Right.
If we know our opponents' abilities,
it'll be easier to plan ahead.
Like we did against Genthru.
I'm half agreed, and half opposed.
What do you mean?
I think we should work on our fundamentals,
but I don't think we need to know their abilities.
Huh? Why not?
That just increases our risk of defeat.
Nothing good can come of that!
But that's what we'll be facing in NGL.
Our goal isn't to defeat Knuckle and Shoot...
It's to become stronger,
and return to NGL and save Kite.
In other words,
we must be strong enough to defeat
enemies we know nothing about.
Winning here with advance
preparation is pointless.
That's true,
but we have to defeat these opponents first.
After all, we only have a month.
That's too long.
One week.
In one week, we'll be stronger,
and heading back to NGL!
Go—
Are you an idiot?!
Bisky!
Why are you here?
I asked her to come.
Huh? You know each other?
No, I looked into your backgrounds.
How?
We only know Bisky because...
Once I used my power, it was quite simple.
Now, there's no time to spare.
Let's begin...
The plan to slaughter Morel's disciples.
Um, no.
Let's get started, then.
Osu!
What was that for?!
I'm picking up where I left off.
Are you stupid?
That old man's famous for his nasty nature.
If he tells you to do something in a month,
it probably should take an entire year.
You won't defeat them after a week!
But we have to hurry back and save Kite.
What are you talking about?
That was fun...
Like a dream come true.
I'd love to fight you...
once more.
I see...
All the more reason you shouldn't
return without proper training!
What if you make the same mistake again?!
So typical of her age.
She's always ready with a lecture.
Got it?
Osu...
Let's start training, then.
Begin with Ren!
Maintain that for three hours.
Killua, how long can you last?
In top condition, I can manage
around fifty-five minutes, max.
Until you complete this,
we can't move to the next step.
Train like your lives are on the line!
Come on.
You didn't even last an hour.
Okay, keep working.
They say it takes a month to add ten
minutes to your Ren endurance.
You won't have time to sleep.
Curses...
Those damn cowards ran away!
You bastards deserve to die now!
You have a collar.
Where's your owner?
You're supposed to keep the park clean.
Okay, you can rest for today!
Tomorrow begins in thirty minutes.
Looks like it's time for me to use my power.
Take it away, Cookie-chan.
Magical Esthetician: Piano Massage.
Pink Relief
Excuse me...
I hope this won't offend you,
but I'll let you decide how to train them.
Since my power told me that
you would be the answer.
However,
if they cannot defeat Morel's
disciples after one month,
I doubt I'll be able to restrain myself.
I absolutely must go to NGL.
Honestly, I want to depart this moment.
So after I've waited and waited
and waited and waited and waited,
if this fails now,
I'll probably kill all of you...
Was that a threat?
No, it's a warning.
I'm worried about you all.
So if you think they have no chance,
I recommend that you leave...
Speaking from experience, I'm less
likely to lose my temper that way.
I'm not the one you should tell.
Once they're awake, tell the boys.
Don't worry! We've got this!
You can count on us to get you to NGL.
So let us know if you notice anything.
We'll do our best.
That's how they are.
Have some faith.
Oh, dear!
This won't do at all...
Anyway, I'm more concerned about
what's happening inside NGL.
What is the Chairman's group
doing for the next month?
Well?!
Ah, well...
They mentioned they'd be poking and probing.
Identifying the enemy's strengths,
and weakening their forces...
The experts can't agree on the amount of time
remaining before the King's birth.
The Chairman is operating with two months,
the earliest prediction, as the deadline.
This is bad.
That thing is stronger than I am.
Stronger than the Chairman?
Surely you jest.
If that's really true,
none of the Hunters will be able to fight it.
It's been more than half a century since
I was the strongest among Nen users.
Now, I'm more or less even with you guys.
Then you're more than strong enough.
You should have more confidence.
Even when I'm at less than half my former strength?
Growing old is no fun.
He never stops talking.
But we must fight.
I would prefer to avoid it...
If there were a solution that would
avoid a fight, I'd choose it.
Our target is the Queen,
and the Queen alone.
But sneaking past the surveillance of
that En will be next to impossible.
We cannot avoid a fight...
The question is how we will manage to win.
If anyone has any brilliant ideas,
I'd like to hear them.
You're simply awful.
When you asked us to join, did you not
already have an answer in mind?
We exterminate the Ants
in silence, one at a time.
Yeah, let's take it slow.
Might as well enjoy the job...
Okay...
First, we should learn the enemy's numbers.
Go.
So many.
Something is coming.
They aren't alive...
Is this the enemy's power?
Now, what to do?
You may as well wait.
If they come here, we simply destroy them.
You have a point.
These could be decoys.
Huh, what?
Was I speaking aloud?
No.
I simply knew what you were thinking.
Who are you, anyway?
One of the Queen's Royal Guard.
Shaiapouf.
Menthuthuyoupi will also soon awaken.
Nyow I see. So you're Shaiapouf.
Yes, that is correct.
You can read all my thoughts.
Not sure I like that.
Well, I can understand the sentiment.
But...
He will wake soon.
That's good news!
You see, I haven't been able to
decide what power to develop.
Right, it's so simple.
I merely need to fix him.
I only need the power to do that.
And then, I will be able to experience
that dreamlike moment with you
once more...
Come on, what are you doing?
You'll never defeat Knuckle and Shoot,
much less the Chimera Ants, like this.
Are you giving up on going to NGL?
N-No way...
We never give up.
We must return to NGL, no matter
what we have to do to get there!
To save Kite...
After reuniting with Bisky,
Gon and Killua are back to training.
They have one goal:
to get strong enough to save Kite.
Right now, that motivation is driving Gon.
Next time: Duel x and x Escape.
It's on, Killua!
It's on, Gon!
Rock, paper... Rock!
I lost...
﻿Right, it's so simple.
I merely need to fix him.
I only need the power to do that.
The question is how we will manage to win.
If anyone has any brilliant ideas,
I'd like to hear them.
You're simply awful.
When you asked us to join, did you not
already have an answer in mind?
We exterminate the Ants
in silence, one at a time.
Come on, what are you doing?
You'll never defeat Knuckle and Shoot,
much less the Chimera Ants, like this.
N-No way...
We never give up.
We must return to NGL, no matter
what we have to do to get there!
To save Kite...
Promise x And x Reunion
As the Queen prepares for the King's birth,
she requires the equivalent of two hundred
and fifty human meatballs per day
to give birth to a strong King.
It moved.
Meanwhile, Gon and Killua
continue their training so they
can defeat Knuckle and Shoot,
take their tokens, and return to NGL.
Will this really be enough for
them to execute the plan
to slaughter Morel's disciples?
Okay, all done!
You finally lasted for three hours.
We did it...
That was hard!
I can't move an inch...
What are you talking about?
Stand up.
We're going out.
Huh?
Where to?
To see Knuckle.
Wh-Why?
See? You can move.
Let's go!
Tell us why we're going to see Knuckle.
Jeez, don't ask questions
with obvious answers.
To fight him!
Huh?!
Okay, let's go!
What are you talking about?
We still have time.
What if we lose?
You just try again.
Huh?
Whether you win or lose isn't important.
All that matters is who ends
up with the tokens, right?
Yeah.
Which means you must take theirs.
If it looks like you'll lose, run.
Then try again the next day.
From here on, you'll practice
Ren for three hours a day.
After that, you'll challenge Knuckle.
And you'll continue until you win.
Still a no show, huh?
Your owner's really bad...
Hey, stop it!
That tickles.
Cut it out!
Hey, come on...
Is that Knuckle?
Yeah.
No way...
They're the other candidates?
Guess they must not respect me...
If I'm being compared to a couple of kids,
they must not think I'm very strong...
Eh?!
Such an intimidating presence...
We should act first, but we can't move!
A duel is a battle to the death.
Serious business!
It's best to fight five hours
after a good night's sleep.
So what's with you kids?
You're completely worn out!
Were you just out swimming or something, eh?
Take this seriously!
You kids can never defeat me.
Are you crying?
S-Stupid...
Wh-Why would I cry?
I'm not upset about this.
Th-Th-These are just, well, uh...
Tears from laughing too much, fool.
I'll kill you, get it?
So don't tell anyone!
Punch me!
Huh?
I'll show you how much stronger I really am.
And you'll realize that I don't need
to bother dodging your punches.
Hit me as many times as you like.
But if I don't take a step from this spot,
leave your tokens behind.
This is the best chance you'll have!
You kids would need a hundred years
before you could try fighting me!
You're the one who challenged us to a duel.
Don't look down on us!
I'd like to respond that way...
But it's clear that we aren't on Knuckle's level.
We have no right to argue that.
Not right now...
The fact is,
we can't overcome everything with willpower.
We can't argue with him...
But we don't have to accept it!
I won't stop hitting you until you move.
Enough talk...
Just get to it.
First comes rock!
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
What's with the intense aura?
That's cheating!
I'll use Gyo...
No, I have to defend with Ko.
Crap...
But where do I defend?
If I guess wrong,
I could die...
Come on...
I'd expect him to attack the belly.
Yeah, that's the only real choice.
Gotta be the belly.
Rock...
Yeah, it's the belly!
Belly! Belly! Belly!
Paper...
Rock!
Knuckle-san?
You okay?
I... trusted... you...
What's with him?
Obviously, he's a total idiot.
Oh, are you awake?
You're stronger than I thought.
Guess I underestimated you...
Why didn't you take this?
You should've taken the
token and ditched me.
We don't want your token.
We want the strength to defeat
you in a straight-up fight.
Could I ask you something?
Sure, go ahead.
Why did you become a Beast Hunter?
Huh?
It's a long story...
And it brings back bad memories.
Then, why did you volunteer for the punitive force?
Simply put, to keep it from doing its job.
I don't like the idea of cutting off
whatever doesn't fit the mold.
My teacher says I'm just a softy.
But you can't judge something that
you've never seen before...
First, you have to exchange blows.
And you'll get yourself killed in the process!
You're a good kid.
Now that we've fought, I see that.
You, too.
Huh?
You!
He wouldn't leave your side.
They say good Hunters are well-liked by animals.
S-Stupid!
I'm not crying...
Don't tell anyone!
Or I'll kill you...
Morel's student...
It's good!
Fight me any time you want.
Huh?
I'll give you as many tries as you want.
But it's impossible for you to beat me
in the twenty days left.
Good stuff.
What is this smoke?
Where am I?
All right...
Let's begin, then.
What?
Chiona's squadron is missing?
Yes...
Is it similar to what happened
to Reikei's squadron?
It appears so.
The leader disappeared first,
and then the rest vanished, one by one.
Are the humans fighting back?
Well, that is the logical conclusion.
We've been cutting down on
the number of soldiers,
and our prey has begun to scatter.
If humans target us during an extended hunt,
it could be trouble.
Should we ask the Queen to move the castle?
No, we can't trouble the Queen right now.
Then we ask Neferpitou-dono to investigate?
That idea doesn't thrill me...
I'll let you handle things outside...
We'll protect the inside of the castle.
I'll try to strengthen this.
Just as I expected...
Well, at least she doesn't issue
any strange orders on a whim.
We should start by determining
our current troop strength.
How many Squadron Leaders remain?
Assuming Chiona was taken out, twenty-eight.
Each Squadron Leader has four or five officers...
And each officer commands
ten to fifteen soldiers.
Some squadrons are under tight control,
but many are free to wander around.
The missing four squadrons fall
under the latter category...
Of the remaining squadrons,
over half lack discipline.
And none will heed a warning.
They've become arrogant since learning Nen.
Then we could use them to lay a trap.
I'm sure that's what's currently going
through the enemy's mind...
Well, we should be able to
continue the current plan.
Yes.
Knov and I will be able to tell
once a trap has been laid.
In fact, I believe we should
spring a few of those traps.
Hmm?
If we ignore the disciplined squads,
they'll band together and cause us problems.
Most likely, they'll start pairing
disciplined and undisciplined squads together.
If we launch an indiscriminate
attack, it will result in chaos.
We should be able to eliminate
another three or four squads
before the enemy tries another approach.
I can already see their next move.
If all goes well, we'll finish up
before reinforcements arrive.
I hope
things go that way.
Okay, three hours! All done!
Well, then... Get going.
Here.
What, there are more of you?
Don't hold back...
Help yourselves.
They're here.
It's on, Knuckle!
Yeah, let's go!
I'll take you both on at once!
I won't say a word about
how you're condescending to us...
We're more than happy to accept!
Let's go, Killua!
Yeah!
Come on...
I have no time to waste playing
around with you kids.
You have nothing but time.
Get serious!
That's more like it!
Their bodies are completely fatigued.
All that's moving them is sheer willpower.
Once they've accomplished
the tough task before them,
they'll gain a confidence boost
that will spur their growth.
However, to complete that task,
they must defeat me!
And that ain't gonna happen
on my watch!
Come on!
That all you've got?
Given his personality,
he's probably already warmed
to these opponents...
I doubt he'd sell me out,
but it's probable that he'll accidentally
say something he shouldn't.
My chance will come after they leave.
I will defeat them...
Next time:
Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.
Hey, Killua.
Stop it, my turn...
That's our weakness!
﻿Given his personality,
he's probably already warmed
to these opponents...
I doubt he'd sell me out,
but it's probable that he'll accidentally
say something he shouldn't.
My chance will come after they leave.
I will defeat them...
Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness
The man targeting Gon and Killua
is named Shoot McMahon.
He, too, is one of Morel's students.
This won't work.
In our current condition,
we don't stand a chance...
Yeah.
I'm pretty sure that Knuckle's using
less than half of his strength.
Probably so.
But we have to fight him.
Yeah...
I don't sense anyone else around.
It's the perfect chance.
When I take my target down, I am
always deliberate and thorough.
That's what it takes to be a UMA Hunter.
Here we go... This is my chance.
What's wrong?
It's the perfect opportunity.
Right now, I can easily...
Go...
Go!
Shoot McMahon...
He is a coward.
Hey, Killua...
Why wasn't Knuckle-san good enough?
Hmm? What do you mean?
Why didn't they let him go to NGL?
He seems really strong to me.
Well, that's true.
In terms of physical ability,
he'd be a match for Kite.
It's probably a mental thing.
Mental?
His approach isn't in line
with this mission's objective.
He's too soft.
And he gets attached to animals too easily.
And he did end up volunteering
to help us, somehow...
And the number of dogs around keeps increasing.
Yeah...
They can maintain their Ren for two hours
without having to really concentrate.
That's a good sign...
If they can do it for three hours,
I might consider letting them fight
Knuckle when they're fully rested.
Knuckle will then be forced
to use his full strength.
I hope it will be enough to teach them...
That which they lack, that which they need.
But that still only takes them halfway.
If everything goes well, it'll take them
about ten days to reach that point.
And that means they'll have no more
than a day left before time's up...
I'm not sure they can make it.
I should probably prepare for my escape...
Save my own skin.
Help yourself.
Thanks!
Yum!
What do you think?
Oh, this is really good!
Not that!
We only have ten days.
Huh?
From what I've seen,
you're only two-thirds through your training
to become strong enough
to force Knuckle into using his full strength...
Uh-oh...
She knows exactly what's going on.
Huh? Is that true, Bisky?
But it'll be fine!
We'll definitely beat him before the deadline!
How can you be so sure?!
The situation hasn't improved at all...
You said it was all right for
me to speak up, so I will.
You have no chance to defeat Knuckle!
They didn't give you enough time...
Lately, I find myself gripping a kitchen knife,
staring at it to calm myself.
That means I'm nearly over the edge,
so if you run at once, before it's too late,
I probably won't try to chase and kill you.
If not for her outbursts...
This would be a pleasant meal...
We aren't gonna run away.
How many times do I have to say it?
What else can you do?
As you currently are, you cannot defeat Knuckle!
We'll win!
Pinky swear.
Come on... Hurry up!
I pinky swear that we'll beat Knuckle
and Shoot before the deadline.
If I break my promise, I have to
swallow a thousand needles...
Pinky sworn!
On the island I'm from, there's another part.
You go like this and put your thumbs together.
Sealed with a kiss!
Okay, now it's a promise.
By the way, Palm-san,
what did you use to flavor this?
Oh... Ah, it's broth from chicken bones...
Gon's getting really good at handling Palm.
I suspect she's the one leading
things in that direction...
I let a Kunai chicken cook overnight,
then I let it sit for another night.
Ten days left.
Don't say that like a countdown to our death!
This is it...
Smoke that covers the forest like fog.
Baital squad here.
Goran, give me an update.
Goran, do you read me?
Goran!
Could they have already taken him out?
Anyone from Goran's squad out there?
Give me a report!
Hey...
We can't see anything with all this smoke...
We've been trying to reach Squadron
Leader Goran, but he won't respond!
Any sign of the leader?
I can't see the guy in front
of me! What's going on?!
I've lost contact with him!
He was right beside me a moment ago!
I can't see a thing!
He just vanished into the smoke!
Yah! There's a hole!
With all these messages,
I can't tell what's happening...
They should've established a communication
network to operate in the leader's absence.
Baital squad, forward!
Find Goran's squadron and converge with them.
Zemu and Pokoro squadrons will act
as rearguard for the Baital squad!
Proceed in a V formation!
The number of soldiers is dropping.
What's happening?
Now.
Hey, Baital?
So you're next?
Are you sure this is a good idea?
What do you mean?
All we do is send enemies to the old man.
He's the one who takes them out.
This is a little too easy.
But it is a surefire method.
Can't argue there.
The Chairman was being modest...
He's still much stronger than we are.
And he seems rather excited about this.
Oh, speak of the devil.
Keep sending them my way.
I'm finally starting to regain my touch.
Impressive...
And how about the Queen?
She hasn't made a move.
The Queen is still holed up in her nest.
Then the King hasn't been born yet.
Continue to monitor the situation.
Roger that.
The old man's on a roll.
Shall we grab another squadron?
Yeah.
Baital and Gafutsu's squadrons haven't returned.
We're down to fourteen squadrons.
Damned humans.
How are they managing to whittle us down?
I don't know.
All I know is that there are some
humans who are very strong.
We know too little about humans.
They appear to possess a variety
of powers far stronger than ours.
Had we more time, we could
obtain that power, as well.
However, once the King is born,
we will hold the advantage.
Yes, I hope that will be the case.
You want to come out?
Not yet.
It's still too early.
Okay, that's three hours!
Oh? Already?
That seemed fast.
Then I'll give you a thirty-minute break.
Huh?
Aren't we supposed to fight Knuckle now?
You can go once you're rested.
Defeat him.
You have a little over a day
before the Chairman's deadline.
This may be your first and last chance.
Well, if they're able to fight at full strength,
they'll have to accept the results, win or lose.
If they can each identify what they're missing,
then this training was a success.
Now, the problem is figuring out my escape...
Seems you kids are serious tonight.
Morning, Youpi.
Youpi?
To be precise, your name is Menthuthuyoupi.
I'm hungry.
Before we begin, I want to
know where your partner is.
Eh? You mean Shoot?
Yeah.
Why do you want to know that?
You're about to get the crap knocked out of you.
We need both tokens.
That's a riot!
If you defeat me, I'll tell you.
We might not get a chance to ask you then.
You might be out cold.
You're no longer amusing me...
There!
Gon!
That hit hard.
I could feel the impact
throughout my entire body.
If I drop my Ken, his next
punch will knock me out.
After another four or five warm-up punches,
I'll get serious...
Better watch yourself.
I warm up fast.
Still no one coming out today?
No.
As expected, they've holed up inside.
Shall we make our move?
No, we're approaching the
deadline for your disciples.
We can wait until that's over.
Judging by the estimated number of
bodies currently stored in the nest,
they'll need to replenish in a week or so.
I would like to dispatch another
two or three squadrons at that time.
Okay, I'll leave it in your hands.
We don't move until we know
how our disciples performed.
I think it's a waste of time...
Knuckle and Shoot might be able to help,
but the old man's kids don't seem too reliable.
We can't count on them for anything in a fight.
At best, they could act as decoys.
Hell, they'd probably get in our way...
I'm certain of it.
That old man always was a gambler...
Want to bet whose disciples
will show up tomorrow?
I'll put 100,000 Jenny on Knuckle and Shoot.
If we're both wrong,
the Chairman gets the money.
How about it?
Sure.
Then, I'll put...
...1,000,000 on them.
Huh? That's just impossible!
Are you trying to throw your money to the dogs?
The Chairman is a dog?
I happen to love gambling.
I always roll high...
There!
Behind you, fool!
He's still warming up?
Damn, he's strong!
But why is Knuckle...
Could it be...
Hey, aren't you going to use
that "First comes rock" thing?
Well, you won't be able to use that technique.
It's flawed, after all.
It's flawed?
A word of advice...
If you try that technique,
I'll stop you in your tracks.
In a one-on-one match, you'd better not try it.
Your technique
has two huge weaknesses!
I'm not sure I can accomplish this mission
without sacrificing someone...
Next time: Compassion x And x Strength.
And love and sorrow!
And reassurance...
No biggie!
﻿Your technique
has two huge weaknesses!
Compassion x And x Strength
Gon has finally challenged
Knuckle to a serious fight.
However, Knuckle claims that
Gon's technique has serious flaws.
So, Gon...
What did you name that technique?
Oops! I think I forgot to name my attack.
Ja-Janken!
Wow, zero effort...
Jajanken...
I understand.
You combined "jajan" for "ta-dah," with
"janken" for your attack, "Rock-Paper-Scissors."
Ah, no...
The first "ja" was a stutter.
Not a bad name, kid!
Uh, yeah.
Guess I'm okay with that.
You are?!
Gon, your Jajanken has two huge weaknesses.
First, it takes too long to charge.
During a fight, you don't have time
to stand still for several seconds.
I wouldn't count on having the time to charge it.
I know that.
Second, it's too risky.
When you focus aura in your
fist to increase power,
you have less aura for defense.
One attack to the wrong place
will take you out, fool!
I know the risks.
That's why I've spent the past month
training to compensate for them!
Now that I see it again,
his aura really is something.
In terms of volume, he has
as much as a mid-level pro.
He's so close...
But you still lack
experience.
You haven't been in
enough real fights!
You've got plenty of determination.
It seems you've looked death
in the eye many times,
and you have natural talent.
However, you're still unrefined.
Your aura is too rough!
I can tell which area you're defending.
I can see what you're trying to do.
Your aura gives it all away.
So if I use that information to fake you out,
shifting your intended point of attack...
This is the result!
Damn...
His aura is giving away his every move!
I was right! Knuckle really is...
Okay, then...
Time to throw a real punch.
He's so...
Don't blame me if you die.
He's so gentle!
Behind you, fool!
Without his warning, I could have died.
First, it takes too long to charge.
He's teaching me when he doesn't have to...
And providing guidance.
He's telling me how to become stronger.
He's too gentle!
First comes rock...
I told you that you won't pull off that attack.
Don't fool around with me!
That was your full strength?
Which one of us is fooling around?!
It's supposed to be a serious fight!
You should be fighting to kill, Knuckle!
First comes rock...
Here I go!
Rock...
Over here!
First comes rock...
Rock...
Bastard...
He faked me out with his Jajanken.
It's obvious that you're focused
on stopping my special attack.
Even I could tell exactly when your
right arm was going to strike.
He's using Jajanken's weakness, the long
charge time, against his opponent.
He's playing mind games.
Knuckle sees Gon's Jajanken as an easy pitch.
He has to swing for it.
It's a perfect pitch, right down the
middle, that he has to send flying.
That's the trigger.
When you see the easy ball, you tense up.
You can hit it. You have to.
These thoughts make you use
more strength than necessary.
The same thing applies to aura.
If a Nen user doesn't control their aura,
it will gather in areas of tension.
The moment of the swing, it intensifies further.
If the Nen user is inexperienced or out of control,
the aura will either stagnate
or just flow too freely.
The flow of the aura
lets the opponent sense
when an attack will come.
You should be fighting to kill, Knuckle!
By calling him out for being soft,
Gon threw Knuckle off.
As a result, he managed to fake Knuckle out.
I'd think this tactic would be more effective
on those who know Jajanken's strength.
Opponents who have seen how
strong the technique can be
will be more scared and likely to lose
control when they see it coming.
The fake-out will be more believable,
and if the enemy steps back,
they're easier to hit with Scissors or Paper.
I always assumed Jajanken
would be less useful once opponents
figured out how it works.
That it was flawed.
But I was wrong.
It can be adapted to any situation.
Okay, let's try this again.
In the second attempt, he was
too focused on the technique
and let Knuckle land a kick on him.
But if he learns to better control his aura
in response to the opponent's movement,
it will be harder to distinguish between
fake and real Jajanken attempts.
Gon's been thinking how to shore
up his technique's weaknesses.
No...
He thought of the solution during this fight.
He's making incredible progress while fighting.
I'm already getting tired.
We haven't even been
fighting for twenty minutes.
Moving so much is sapping my energy.
If an hour of training is comparable
to ten minutes of fighting,
I'll only be able to maintain my Ken for another ten minutes.
If my aura defense goes down, I'm finished.
Before then, I have to end this.
By using Jajanken.
Bring it!
Knuckle definitely has superior physical strength.
But Gon is adapting, little by little.
By increasing the area his aura covers,
he reduces the damage from miscalculations.
And he's getting used to Knuckle's speed.
Sudden punches almost never hit him anymore.
But he's running out of time.
He doesn't have much stamina
left to maintain his aura.
On the other hand, Knuckle has
been conserving his strength,
only attacking with physical blows.
Jajanken requires a large
amount of aura just to charge.
A fake Jajanken still drains a fair amount.
Gon's already activated his technique three times.
They started fighting twenty minutes ago.
If he uses Jajanken again,
he'll only have a minute or two
to fight at full strength.
Gon...
You told me to use my full strength,
but you're no match for me right now.
You're...
First comes
rock...
Why?
What...
is he going to do?
First comes
rock...
Why?
Knuckle's in good shape and alert,
and he's attacking from that distance?
He isn't even going to hit Knuckle.
This is definitely Gon's final attack.
This will end it.
Rock... Scissors...
Paper!
An Emitter attack?
But it's much weaker than his Rock.
You're definitely an Enhancer.
Your power as an Emitter is far lower.
No speed... No punch.
He can't have any more tricks up his sleeve.
Once I knock that aside, it's over!
Once again!
Once again?
He used that ball as cover
to move behind me?
Crap!
Two Jajankens in a row...
Rock!
He must have depleted his
aura before Rock hit.
Otherwise, I'd be the one on the ground...
Where are you going, fool?
I'm going back.
Aren't you going to fight?
I'm fine here.
You can fight Gon again tomorrow.
The outcome will probably be different.
I'll defeat Shoot.
Tell Gon this.
Tomorrow, I'll be fighting for real.
He'd better be prepared to die.
It sounds like you're trying to convince yourself.
Sure you're up to the task?
Hell, yeah, fool.
Tomorrow...
As long as you win,
it's fine if you don't get serious.
But if you lose without fighting at full strength,
I won't forgive you.
I'll never forgive you, as long as I live.
You're still soft.
Why are you helping the enemy?
And the enemy is blasting you for it, as well...
If you don't want to go to NGL,
hand over your token to them.
Though I'm sure that they'll refuse it.
Bastard...
You're pretty cocky when you aren't
shaking in your boots, eh?
The past month, all you've done is stalk them!
I'll fight.
Tomorrow, I'll join the fight.
Don't worry.
I gave him a massage, so he'll be able to fight
in top condition tomorrow.
Killua's the real issue...
I wasn't expecting him to go
the whole month without fighting once.
Killua!
Fight me.
Huh?
What happened to your face, Killua?!
Huh? I was training with Bisky.
Training? Are you sure it wasn't a lynching?
Anyway, are you feeling okay?
Yep, I feel great.
I used up all my aura, so I expected
to be tired, but look!
That gorillâ€”
That old hag's massage must have done the trick.
That was close.
Listen now...
If you tell anyone what happened yesterday,
I'll make your face three times worse.
She wasn't joking.
Now, do you know your weakness?
You're too quick to give up.
You're too cautious about fighting.
Some might say you underestimate yourself.
When facing an enemy you
believe to be stronger,
you fight on the premise of escaping.
I realize that this isn't your fault.
It's the fault of whoever taught you to fight.
Habits that are burned into your
body and soul aren't easy to break.
But I can say one thing for sure.
Somewhere down the line,
you'll leave Gon behind to die.
Combat ability can change,
depending on environment
and physical condition.
For example, a good-condition C
has a high chance of defeating
a poor-condition D.
If the conditions are right, A, B, and C
all have the potential to defeat D.
But in your case, you're assuming
the enemy is always at their best.
You always assume the worst-case scenario.
Even when facing enemies with equal strength,
you worry about how strong they are,
or what they might do to you.
If we're talking about a stronger
enemy, there's no question...
You don't bother to think of how you could win.
Running is your only option.
That's how losers think.
Suppressing that bad habit and forcing yourself
to face enemies stronger than
you will take determination.
If you can't defeat Shoot tomorrow,
you must leave Gon's side.
Okay! I'm gonna win this time!
Let's go.
Yeah.
Killua's overly cautious style is the
product of a smothering love.
A twisted, self-serving love...
That just makes his habits stronger,
deeper, and harder to break.
Without extraordinary willpower,
this curse cannot be broken.
I don't know who will emerge victorious...
All right, then...
Time to run for it.
The loser...
Hands his token to the winner.
Gon and Knuckle.
Killua and Shoot.
Their final battle begins.
Next time: Interest x And x Curse.
Who are you calling slow, fool?
Are you saying I'm cursed, fool?
﻿He's so...
He's so gentle!
He's teaching me when he doesn't have to...
And providing guidance.
He's telling me how to become stronger.
When facing an enemy you
believe to be stronger,
you fight on the premise of escaping.
Somewhere down the line,
you'll leave Gon behind to die.
If you can't defeat Shoot tomorrow,
you must leave Gon's side.
Interest x And x Curse
As they prepare to challenge Knuckle and Shoot,
Gon and Killua are deep in thought.
The loser...
Hands his token to the winner.
Gon...
As promised,
I'm coming at you
at full power!
If it's a speed contest, he can toy with me.
I have to be ready to take the hit...
And counterattack!
Don't follow him by sight.
Sense his motions...
Through my aura!
A little late, but I sensed his approach!
But what's going on?
I feel power rushing through my body...
It's time.
Adding interest.
Wh-What is this thing?
I let you borrow
some of my aura.
You let me borrow your aura?
By the way, I charge ten percent interest.
Ten percent
every ten seconds!
If you don't repay the debt, you'll bust.
It's time.
Adding interest.
I call this ability "Chapter 7 Bankruptcy."
I Alone Lose When It Reaches the Heavens
I Alone Lose When It Reaches the Heavens
Chapter 7 Bankruptcy
That's the mascot, Amortizing Power Redirector.
Attacking APR is a waste of time...
It'll just hang around you,
telling you when your interest goes up.
It's both harmless and invincible.
Though it can be an eyesore...
It's time.
Adding interest.
Again.
It doesn't hurt at all...
Instead, I feel another power rush.
It's time.
Adding interest.
It suddenly almost doubled?!
That's because I just lent you
another 180 aura.
180 aura?
What do these numbers mean?
It seems you have no clue what I'm talking about.
"180 aura" is a numeric measure
of your spiritual power.
Aura accumulates in the body,
and your Maximum aura Output Potential (MOP)
varies according to your training.
Also, there is a limit on how much
aura you're able to release at once,
which can be raised through training.
In other words,
Present aura Output Potential [POP]
your POP, the latent aura inside you, doesn't matter.
If you haven't trained to increase your AOP,
Present aura Output Potential [POP]
Actualized aura Output Potential [AOP]
the amount of aura you can actually release,
1000 aura                                      200 aura
you'll be at a huge disadvantage. Get it, fool?
When you use Ken, you can sustain
a maximum 1,800 aura around your body.
When preparing for battle,
you usually expend 1 aura per second.
However, once the fight begins,
you begin to use advanced techniques such as Gyo, Ryu, and Ken,
which require considerable Nen.
This increases the rate you expend
aura by six to ten times.
The stronger your techniques,
the more aura you use up.
Got that, fool?
Your control is still weak,
so you're burning 10 aura every second.
That's 600 aura you expend per minute in battle.
In yesterday's fight, you ran
out after twenty minutes...
So, in a regular fight, you used up 12,000 aura.
Then add your four Jajankens!
Your AOP is around 1,800 aura.
But at the moment you called out "Jan"
to activate Jajanken, the aura focused
in your fist was over 2,000.
That's due to its long charge and your defensive
sacrifice, done to focus aura in your fist.
A special provision covers such risks
attributed to special attacks.
You expended around 5,500 aura
with the first three Jajanken shots!
That puts your total consumed aura at 17,500.
As for the fourth shot...
Right before your do over hit, you ran out of energy.
Assuming that you needed twice the
usual aura amount to complete the attack,
the fourth shot required 4,000 aura.
The amount of aura used up is
the same for Rock and Paper.
However, Paper falls within a different category,
and you haven't practiced much,
so you used up 4,000 aura on a weak attack.
That probably only had the strength
of about a 500-aura attack.
Thus, your maximum POP
is around 21,500 aura!
I wasn't expecting this kind of attack...
Looks like you're not good at math.
But I'm just getting started!
Listen up, fool!
When your borrowed aura, including interest,
surpasses your current remaining POP,
you'll bust.
Aura works like a bank account balance.
If you keep spending, your balance decreases...
But the interest keeps skyrocketing!
It's been a few minutes since we started.
You've used up at least 2,000.
Take a look.
It's huge!
That's not all...
It's three times what it was before?
That can't be right!
It's only been two or three minutes!
To be precise, it's been 120 seconds.
This exemplifies how interest
can snowball on you.
It's time.
Adding interest.
Even after adding in the
390 aura I've lent you, you're under 20,000.
Your debt will continue to grow.
Even if you stand perfectly still,
in 260 seconds, or 4 minutes and 20 seconds,
you'll bust.
Bankrupt
What happens if I bust?
APR will become the
Individual Ren Suppressor,
and spend thirty days tracking the target.
During that time, the target will
remain in a state of Zetsu.
Basically, unable to use any Nen.
It's too late to regret fighting me now, fool!
That's why he didn't use this ability earlier.
He held back for my sake...
Knuckle!
Thank you.
Here I come!
That punch just now was around 150...
You returned 150 to me,
but I lent you another 180.
The net impact is that your
loan increases by 30...
What will you do now?
Until your debt is repaid,
I won't take damage from your attacks.
It's time.
Adding interest.
Yeah, come at me, fool!
If you just stand around, you'll bust
after the four minutes expire!
You managed to land more hits.
But ultimately, you only returned about 100.
It's time.
Adding interest.
That's just a drop in the bucket.
You repaid less than half your
last interest payment...
I won't let you launch Jajanken again.
Once your debt passes 10,000,
my victory is assured.
It's time.
Adding interest.
Wh-What is that?
Can't let him intimidate me.
Neither of us knows anything
about the other's abilities!
I don't like hurting other people.
That's why I chose a power that only activates
when I must hurt someone.
To give myself a weapon that only works
against those I have no qualms about hurting.
However...
You boys have taught me
that a worthy opponent deserves my full strength.
Three hands?
How?
They're floating?!
What kind of power is this?
Should I attack first?
Stay calm...
Observe the situation with Gyo!
He's not using In.
There are three floating hands.
That means,
most likely, he's a Manipulator.
That cage is also a mystery.
He doesn't need it if he plans to use
those flying hands to attack.
In other words...
Touching those hands is dangerous!
Yo-yos, huh?
Let's see what you can do.
He's amazingly adept...
He's fast!
Those hands were just a distraction?
Jump back.
When facing an enemy you
believe to be stronger,
you fight on the premise of escaping.
No way...
That's no different from what I've always done.
Use electricity!
Couldn't get the attack off!
My body won't listen to me...
This...
is my curse.
His reaction was slow.
Is something wrong?
Stop... Don't think about it.
It's my bad habit.
His circumstances don't matter.
Do my best to defeat him.
Otherwise, I'm only insulting him!
He's strong and fast.
He probably has me beat in every area...
That's right, Killua...
That's the way.
Don't fight an enemy you can't beat.
I have to stop thinking that way!
Your weakness is that you're
too quick to give up.
Even when facing enemies with equal strength,
you worry about how strong they are,
or what they might do to you.
If we're talking about a stronger
enemy, there's no question...
You don't bother to think of how you could win.
Running is your only option.
That's how losers think.
I realize that this isn't your fault.
It's the fault of whoever taught you to fight.
Habits that are burned into your
body and soul aren't easy to break.
Somewhere down the line,
you'll leave Gon behind to die.
Forget it.
You can't win.
My left eye?
The left side of my face
is gone...
That was a much better reaction.
Was what happened earlier a fluke?
If you take damage without knowing why,
get as far from the enemy as you can.
My curse saved me.
But that isn't good enough!
Suppressing that bad habit and forcing yourself
to face enemies stronger than
you will take determination.
I must fight to win!
I'm blind on the left side...
There it was again.
You reacted quickly.
No! I'm just running away!
I haven't been fighting at all...
If you can't defeat Shoot tomorrow,
you must leave Gon's side!
I'm done running away.
Take this...
Electricity?
Scary.
Doesn't matter... Follow him.
Never overpursue.
Go after him!
How—
Stop.
...did you know?
What am I asking that for?
While Gon and Killua
were fighting for the tokens...
Next time: The Strong x And x The Weak.
Here I come, Killua...
Time to eat!
Bring it!
My yakiniku meal.
﻿How—
Stop.
...did you know?
What am I asking that for?
It's time.
Adding interest.
The Strong x And x The Weak
The time has finally come.
At long last...
Yep.
The King is about to be born!
Wait...
It's too early!
Silence!
I hunger.
Bring me food.
Th-This is our King...
Your Majesty!
O-Oh, no...
Her organs are severely damaged!
Do not make me repeat myself.
Bring me food.
This is a filthy place...
You...
Clean this off.
Ah, I happen to have a handkerchief on me—
Do not make me repeat myself.
I am speaking to you.
Clean this off.
Disgusting.
Where is my food?
This way, please.
We have prepared a meal for you.
The three of us will serve
as your arms and legs.
We shall acquire anything you wish...
And fulfill all of your desires.
We await your command.
Help the Queen!
Stop the bleeding!
Well? How is she?
It looks grim...
She's in very bad shape.
Multiple organs have been crushed
so badly, we cannot heal them!
If something isn't done...
Neferpitou-dono!
The Queen is dying...
We require your assistance!
We need the power you
used to heal that man!
I only healed him because I need him.
Now that the King has been born,
she means nothing to the Royal Guard.
She is no longer necessary.
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!
Well? Will Neferpitou-dono help us?
No, Neferpitou-dono has...
No...
They have all abandoned the Queen.
Abandoned?
We'll have to save the Queen ourselves!
It's impossible!
Weren't you listening to me?
We don't have the power
to heal the damage the Queen has suffered...
Perhaps they have the power we need.
Who are you talking about?
Hey, where are you going?
We have prepared your dinner on the roof,
where there is a fine view.
Then, it would seem faster
to get there from outside.
Magnificent...
Excuse me.
That looks fun...
It seems I need practice.
Disgusting.
You don't like it?
It is horrendously bland.
We haven't been seasoning our food...
No, that is not what I mean.
When I was in her belly,
I was occasionally treated to
wonderfully rich, savory meals.
Ah, you must be talking
about the rare humans.
My body longs for that
indescribable satisfaction.
I wish to feast upon one of them.
As you wish.
In that case...
One of them is heading straight for us.
Have we been seen?
Let's hide...
Wait.
Something seems off...
Look!
A white flag?
We surrender!
We surrender!
But there is one condition...
You must save the Queen!
She no longer has the ability to give birth.
The Queen?
The King has already been born!
Impossible!
It's too early!
He is...
They are all
devils...
What is this?
They put up no fight.
Disgusting.
This is all wrong.
Might I offer some advice?
The brain is the most delicious part of a human.
So I'd recommend dispatching your
prey without harming the head.
Is that so?
Like this?
Magnificent!
I see... This is not so bad.
However...
It is still inedible,
when compared to a rare human.
Might I offer more advice?
There is a way to identify rare humans.
If you use—
Do you insult me?
I am aware
that if I focus, I can see the
energy around their bodies.
The volume of energy reveals their strength.
Please forgive my insolence.
Simply finding and consuming
them is not entertaining.
I enjoy the moments before eating,
before it is clear whether
the human is rare or not.
Since I have already alleviated my hunger.
Incidentally, Pitou...
You are quite strong.
I was trying to kill you.
You have earned my respect.
I am unworthy.
I don't believe it...
He ate a soldier... One of his own.
That isn't entirely correct.
He is a completely different organism.
I imagine he views all other creatures as food.
So what should we do now?
What do you mean?
If the Queen dies, we'll lose
our reason to stay here.
Haven't we already lost our reason to stay?
The Queen can no longer reproduce.
Huh?
That's true.
It's no longer possible for the
Queen to build her kingdom.
In that case, each of us should
try to become a king...
We can do as we please.
Do you realize what you're saying?
You think you can get away with this?
I'm sure we aren't the only ones
who'd like to leave this place.
W-Wait...
Now do you see that you're in the minority?
Please... There's no time!
If the Queen dies,
there will be nothing to hold
the Squadron Leaders back.
Things will spin out of control.
What exactly will happen then?
Most likely, they will imitate the King.
They will leave to build their own
kingdoms by spreading their seed.
If the chain of command collapses,
some of the Captains will also strike out alone.
They will scatter throughout the world
and destroy entire ecosystems.
Are Chimera Ant soldiers
capable of reproduction?
Yes...
They can copulate with females
of other species and reproduce.
Soldiers belonging to a colony led by a queen
will not attempt to reproduce.
But I've read reports
of soldiers attempting to reproduce
following a queen's death.
Well, I'd say we can safely assume he isn't lying.
What's your name?
Colt.
Colt, we're going to take you to our boss.
I need you to tell your story to him directly.
However,
I don't know if he will trust you.
And even if he believes your story,
he may not let you leave alive.
Are you still willing to come with us?
Absolutely! Time is of the essence!
The timing couldn't be worse.
Today is the day our disciples fight it out...
Oh! I completely forgot...
I bet 100,000 that Knuckle
and Shoot would make it.
You bet 1,000,000 that all five would come...
Knuckle...
Huh?
Promise me!
You have to...
You have to save Kite!
Got it...
I promise I'll bring him back.
Rook
I swear on this token.
Killua...
I'm weak...
I never knew...
I never knew
how frustrating
weakness could be!
Gon...
For the thirty days that you can't use Nen...
I'll protect you.
I will do whatever it takes!
After that,
it's goodbye.
Next time: One Wish x And x Two Promises.
Hey, a shooting star!
May we always be together!
﻿I never knew
how frustrating
weakness could be!
Gon...
For the thirty days that you can't use Nen...
I'll protect you.
I will do whatever it takes!
One Wish x And x Two Promises
Colt arrived, under a white flag of
surrender, to ask the Hunters a favor.
His wish was that they save the dying Queen.
After hearing his request, Morel and
Knov took Colt to see Netero.
It's me.
Send over a team of Chimera Ant
researchers immediately.
Hmm?
The king has been born.
Contact Dr. Lee, of the Bonrin Medical School,
and have him bring all
his skilled surgeons and artificial organ experts.
We leave in four hours.
Yes, sir.
We will do everything we can.
Colt-kun...
We'll need your cooperation.
Heart
This may be the last time I wear this...
Hey, is that...
Yes, it's his "heart" T-shirt.
Heart
They say it's a lucky shirt he only
wears when he fights for real.
But I always thought it was a just a rumor...
Colt-kun, it appears that you can use Nen...
Since you've been in the King's presence,
I want you to give me your honest opinion.
How do I compare to the King?
He really is special...
It feels like needles pricking
me all over my body.
Most likely,
you will be unable to lay a finger on him.
You'll be killed by one of his Royal Guard
before you can get close enough.
I see...
I'm happy to hear that.
At this age, I'll be a challenger.
This is exciting stuff.
Morel, I believe your disciples
were to fight today, yes?
Yes.
Take the victors and the research team,
along with Colt, to the nest.
And you, Chairman?
You don't plan to pursue the King alone?
Oh, no...
I'm off to see an old acquaintance.
Don't forget to pay me my one million.
I know.
What are you talking about?
Nothing important.
Let's go.
Yeah.
Everyone else has left.
Most of our soldiers joined
other squadrons and left.
Though a few oddballs did leave
their squadrons to stay here.
I suppose it's fortunate no fighting broke out.
Did you stop the bleeding?
Yes, but I couldn't do anything else for her.
I'm not sure we can, either.
Don't expect too much.
For now, we'll hook her up to artificial organs.
Can you use my organs?
You can have all my blood, as well!
Unfortunately, it won't work.
Chimera Ants from different generations
are completely different organisms.
Just look at how much the Chimera
Ants in your own generation vary.
But the sentiment is appreciated.
We'll do our best, so pray...
That, miraculously, all the organs will function.
Pray...
Is that all I can do?
Someone...
Is anyone there?
Yes, I am by your side!
Please give me your command!
What is it?
Telepathy?
Yes,
the Queen cannot speak as we do.
Can you tell us what she's saying?
Perhaps she has a hint for saving her life.
My son...
Is my son all right?
Did he have any defects?
...defects?
You have nothing to worry about.
He is perfectly healthy, and right now...
And right now, he's taken
the Royal Guard to search
for medicine to help you.
...to help you.
The truth is that, after he killed
and ate Squadron Leaders,
he left in search of a new territory.
I doubt he will return.
He ate them?
The King
has no concern for the Queen's health!
Then, the King is safe?
Yes.
That is wonderful...
Oh, no.
Send the King off at once.
There is no time to waste on my well-being...
My son has the potential to rule the world.
He was born too early,
so I was very worried.
However, it appears...
I have fulfilled my duty...
That was all I wanted.
What are you saying?!
You are our guiding light...
Without you, the rest of us will
lose our way and perish.
I know my body better than anyone else...
I will not last much longer.
However, I have
no regrets.
Please stop!
I beg you... Please live!
Use my body! Please!
Give it a shot!
Until you try, you don't know it won't work!
Listen...
You must listen to what the Queen has to say.
I have one last request...
I thought of a name...
for my son.
For the King...
A name?
Meruem.
It means the light that illuminates all.
Deliver my message to him...
My beloved son...
I failed to protect her again...
I can't protect anyone...
Has something like this happened before?
No, he's probably referring to a memory
from when he was human.
You have memories from
when you were human?
Of course, though naturally, some
remember more than others...
Our human personalities
strongly influence our current behavior.
And many can remember their human names.
Otherwise, it wouldn't have been
as easy to learn to speak.
Hmm?
Th-This is...
There's...
There's something moving!
Don't touch it!
I will...
I will remove it.
I shall protect this child...
I swear it!
This time, I won't fail...
Morel?
Colt...
Can you promise me
that you and that child
will never eat humans?
If you can't make that promise,
you should get out of my sight immediately.
But if you're willing to give your word...
No one will ever lay a finger on you,
not as long as I'm around.
You have my promise!
It isn't a big deal...
I inherited my soft nature from my master.
Okay, I've recovered!
Knuckle and the other Hunters will save Kite.
So I have to become stronger!
So that Kite won't be disappointed
when he comes back.
Ah, so you do understand.
You may have met Kite before we did,
but we've spent more time with him.
After we crossed the mountains, if you'd still
been moping, I would've given you a beating...
And told you that Kite wouldn't
want to see you two like this.
I know he's still alive,
and he doesn't want you to have regrets.
Right now, what should you do?
You must make the correct decision,
and find the will to follow through!
If you're too weak, train more.
There's enough space here
for squats and push-ups.
Yeah, you're right.
Hey, Spin...
Hmm?
Why do you want to be a Hunter?
I need the money to repay a huge debt.
Have you heard of the small-billed swan?
Nope...
It's a species of bird that can only live
in the area around a certain mine.
No one knows why that is.
Is it the water? The food? The weather?
So I bought the entire area where the mine is.
Well, the mine's closed down now.
Kite provided the money for that.
He was the first adult who was willing to listen
to kids who had nothing at all.
Stinn and I were born in that area.
The sight of thousands of small-billed swans taking
flight with the light of dawn at their backs...
That's the oldest, but strongest,
memory Stinn and I have.
When we heard the area would be demolished,
we realized how important it was to us...
Kite said that he envied us.
He doesn't have a home.
Because he doesn't know where he was born.
Once this mission is over,
I can show you two
my treasure.
Th-This is...
Goal!
I am the Speed King.
No one can stop me!
Given Cheetu's speed, he's probably
already crossed the border.
Well, I'll take my time searching...
For my own paradise,
with plenty of food and females.
Cows, pigs, humans, boars, bears...
I'll take any of those if they're plentiful.
Because I am the Glutton King.
The Chimera Ants that were once soldiers
have now departed to become kings.
Meanwhile, the King
is now in the Republic of East Gorteau.
Next time: Date x With x Palm.
A date! A date!
Gon, do you understand what a date is?
Huh? Sure.
It's when a man and womanâ€”
Th-Th-That's enough!
﻿What? Intruders?
Dispose of them.
I'm busy right now.
Don't bother me with reports
I don't need to hear!
Carry on now.
Date x With x Palm
I don't know which nation sent you.
But having entered this palace,
you must now die painful deaths.
Your Majesty...
I needn't even strain my eyes to sense it.
This is a rare human.
An appetizing treat.
This is it...
This is the flavor I sought!
I feel it.
I feel it! I feel it!
This is it!
I can feel power surging through my body!
Nyow I understand...
This is the King's power.
He can take aura from rare humans he consumes.
In other words,
the more he eats, the stronger he will grow.
Hmm? Who are you people?
Guards!
What are you incompetents doing?
Worthless.
I can't sense anything.
Insolent thugs!
Do you know who I am?
A supreme leader of this era,
a king among kings...
I am Masador Diego!
Why does that scum claim to be the king?
In the human world, it is a common phenomenon.
Humans without intelligence or talent
end up in positions of power due
to bloodline or connections.
That defies all logic...
In the hands of an incompetent,
power brings nothing but ruin.
This could only be the work of imbeciles.
We must provide proper guidance.
Absolutely.
However, they serve as quality meat,
and they are a self-renewing resource.
They are an easy food source.
The non-rare humans can be
used to feed our soldiers.
I shall use my godly power
to deal divine punishment!
Leave at once—
Allow me to dispose of this.
I can use it to control other humans.
Do as you like.
P-Please!
S-Spare our lives.
We beg you...
These humans are idiots.
Think as hard as those weak
brains of yours can manage.
Have you ever spared a pig or a cow
as it begged for its life?
The view is excellent.
And there is plenty of space.
I dub this place the Meat Plantation.
It will be used for processing humans.
As you command.
After being defeated by Knuckle
and Shoot, Gon and Killua
return to the inn where Palm waits.
Before I worry about enemies,
I have to protect Gon from Palm.
You must take responsibility.
What?!
You promised to take me to NGL...
You said you'd swallow a thousand needles
if you broke that promise.
Uh-huh, I'm sorry.
I don't want an apology...
But there's no point in having you
swallow a thousand needles.
Yeah.
So what can I do to make up for it?
Let's see...
You must...
do any one thing I say.
Hey!
Right now, do you know how Gon feels—
Okay, I agree!
Go out with me.
Go out with me...
Eh?
Okay.
Huh?
Do you have any idea what you're doing?!
Yeah, but I did say I'd do anything.
And you have no problem
playing dirty like this?!
This is none of your business.
It's our problem.
It's up to the two of us.
You should stay away from her, Gon.
Don't interrupt us!
This is something the two
of us must decide alone.
You just want an excuse to say that!
Just be quiet.
We're going out now...
There's somewhere I really want to go.
Oh, sorry. I can't go out today.
Eh?
Today, I have to train with Killua.
I know!
You can train with us, Palm!
Huh?
What are you talking about?
Didn't you say we'd go out?
Uh-huh.
Then, why is he tagging along?
And why would we train?
Are you toying with me?
This will be a date...
Our first date!
The first date for us!
The! First! Date!
But it isn't a date.
Huh?!
We can have a proper date later.
Since it's our first date, like you said.
Wow...
The word "date" keeps popping up.
And I need time to prepare for it, too.
Prepare? Prepare for what?
That's...
a secret.
You get to find out tomorrow.
Oh...
In that case,
it's fine.
Really...
If you'd explained first,
I wouldn't have been so angry.
Sorry about that.
But I wanted to keep it secret, to surprise you!
You wanted to surprise me?
Gosh...
Let's meet tomorrow, at 10 AM,
in front of the bulletin board.
I'll be there!
Gon, you're amazing!
Huh? What do you mean?
Well, listening to you talk to Palm,
you seemed used to this stuff.
Really?
I was wondering...
Hmm?
Have you been on a date before?
Sure, I have.
Well, most of them were with Mito-san.
Oh, that makes sense...
Wait, who else was there?
Oh, some of the fishing boats
that stopped at Whale Island were full of women,
some of whom only liked younger men...
So I took them around the village
and had them teach me things.
T-Teach him things?
Th-That means...
He's a grown-up!
Women like that were called fanatics.
Haven't you ever been on a date, Killua?
No! Of course not...
I spent all my time training as an assassin.
And ever since I quit, I've been with you.
Oh, yeah.
Right!
And I really don't want that to change...
Somewhere down the line,
you'll leave Gon behind to die.
Damn, I'm about ready to give in...
And this was my own decision...
Hello?
It's Knuckle.
We've located and secured Kite.
Really? Kite's okay?
Knuckle?
I believe that Kite's being controlled by the enemy.
So I wouldn't say that he's okay.
That's fine.
There must be a way to bring him back!
All right, it'll take three days to get back,
so watch out for any soldier ants.
It seems they've scattered far
and wide, imitating the king.
Got it.
Yes!
I knew that Kite was alive!
That's great.
All that's left
is to protect you for a month.
Wow!
Look over here!
I've found a new feeding ground.
There we go.
What's that for?
It's a present for Palm.
Are you sure about this?
If you hand that to her, won't she freak out?
If I just hand it to her, probably...
Whatever... Let's get back to town.
Yeah.
If we encounter soldier ants
here, in the mountains,
we'll be in serious trouble.
Likewise, if we stay in town, the risk of
encountering ants looking for humans is high.
But while other humans are being
targeted, we can escape.
After all, Gon can't currently use his Nen...
So I must protect him.
Even if it means sacrificing everything else!
Let's hurry.
Drop your weapon,
place your hands behind your head,
and lie down on the ground!
If you don't comply within three
seconds, we will open fire.
Three...
Two...
One!
Ready...
Fire!
He disappeared?
Ow!
These guys are so slow...
This is no fun.
On to the next story.
Today, around noon,
an unidentified creature killed
seven people in Pata City.
The creature also injured multiple police
officers who had rushed to the scene,
before escaping into the Miera Mountains.
According to police testimony,
the creature moved at speeds exceeding
two hundred kilometers per hour.
Before leaving, it said, "I'll return
tomorrow. Bring faster humans,"
which means it could be a new
species of Magical Beast.
An evacuation has been ordered
for all area residents.
Pata City and the Miera Mountains...
NGL                                                                                           Republic of

Region
Inninge City
Miera Mountains
Pata City
Qwen City
Dory City
Another city lies between us,
with the Miera Mountains on the opposite side.
We should be okay...
The government has requested that
the Hunter Association capture it,
and the Association has accepted.
Next, we have the weather.
I'm done, Killua!
Tomorrow, we're both on our own.
Yeah, I'll be training all day in the gym.
Yeah, right.
I can't ditch Gon when he's
essentially defenseless...
Gon-kun, over here.
Hmm?
I didn't recognize you!
Who are you?!
Do I look strange?
Nope, you look really pretty!
Wait, stop it... You're too loud.
You're embarrassing me...
What? I'm just telling the truth.
That's enough. Let's go.
Quickly.
Damn...
What am I doing?
Now I look like the stalker!
No, don't let it get to me.
I have to protect Gon!
There's no telling when
the enemy will show up.
How far are they going to go?
Something's there.
This aura is probably from a soldier ant.
It isn't that close,
but it isn't that far, either.
There are faint aura traces around.
Did it already pass through the area?
Or were they brought here by the wind?
Either way, there's a high
risk our paths will cross!
Should I warn them?
We're here.
Eh?
It's beautiful...
No,
there's no point in telling them.
Gon can't use his Nen.
If he gets upset about Kite and flies
off the handle with rage, he's finished.
Knowing Palm, she'll definitely
go nuts if I interrupt her date.
If she breaks the silence with her shrieks,
Use this chair.
the nearby ants will notice us.
Thank you, I'm fine.
I can't let them know...
I'll take care of this myself!
Oh, I thought I smelled a human...
That's...
I remember you.
You're one of those kids from before!
Looks like your luck's run out.
You're about to get a taste of hell.
But it won't last forever.
I moved upwind to catch his attention
and draw him away from them.
I've done what I had to.
But...
Where's the other kid?
Once you tell me his location,
I'll give you an easy death.
Well, he can't be that far away...
He's your buddy, right?
Well, it doesn't matter if you talk or not.
I'll just walk around making lots of noise
and swinging your severed head.
Then he'll come to me himself.
Isn't that how humans are?
He's right.
I have to defeat him,
or it's all over!
I'll do whatever it takes to protect Gon!
Next time: Friend x And x Journey.
Going back to Whale Island with Killua...
Looking up at the stars with Gon.
We're going on a journey!
﻿I have to defeat him,
or it's all over!
I'll do whatever it takes to protect Gon!
Friend x And x Journey
Determined to protect Gon
for the thirty days he can't use Nen,
Killua prepares for a fight with a Chimera Ant.
However...
Run.
Yes! That's more like it!
That terrified expression...
I love it!
Damn, I'm getting excited now...
I'm gonna tear you apart.
If you aren't certain you can win, run.
I have to protect him... I have to...
When you know nothing of your opponent...
...protect Gon.
...run away.
No matter what!
Is there something special about that tree?
Just wait a little longer.
Amazing...
They're seaside fireflies.
They're only found around brackish water,
and this is their breeding season.
It's beautiful!
Isn't it?
You piss yourself or something?
Well?!
Can't even move a muscle?
Lose your spine?
Damn, this feels so good...
Should I kill him?
Ah, but I want to enjoy this!
Here.
It's a present.
This is the most beautiful flower in the world.
It is?
Stay still.
The tree's sap is very similar to
the pheromones fireflies emit,
so they tend to gather around branches.
I'm so happy...
Thank you.
Really?
I'm glad to hear that.
But I...
I can't give you what you truly want.
What I truly want?
Time alone with me.
Eh?
I...
I want to become stronger.
Strong enough to defeat the Chimera Ants.
That means I have to train harder.
In two days, Kite's coming back.
But it sounds like he's under enemy control.
To return him to normal, I'll probably
have to fight whoever is controlling him.
So until Kite is back to normal...
Or if possible, until the
Chimera Ants are defeated...
I want to focus on my training.
Yes... Yes!
Are you okay with that?
Huh?
What was that?
Damn! I can't get enough!
Run...
Hurry.
No...
Gon!
I will...
...protect you.
Because
we're friends...
You're my dear friend!
Stop that...
Don't look at me like that.
I c-can't stop myself...
I'll kill you.
I'll kill you! I'll kill you...
Run.
Shut up!
Run.
I won't listen to you!
Run... Run... Run...
Shut up!
I'll leave the head, but eat the rest!
Run.
I don't want
to lose him!
Run.
Gon is...
Run.
...my...
Run.
...dear...
Run.
It has to be Killua.
My very dear friend!
He disappeared?
He fooled me good.
Illumi must have planted this
inside my head.
Huh? What are you talking about?
Have you lost your mind?
And how did you dodge that?
Wait, I saw the whole thing.
Right before I reached him,
he jammed his finger into his own head.
And then he vanished,
before popping up over there.
Yeah, I feel so much better now.
I'm completely awake now.
Or maybe I should say I'm liberated.
That's all that happened! Nothing more...
This can't be happening!
Now I'm the one who's afraid?!
I have a message for the other Ants.
If you come anywhere near us,
your lives are over.
That's bull!
Very well.
Then don't bother.
They're gone.
Their stuff's still here...
Were other Ants nearby?
I don't sense any.
That means...
What are you doing?!
Eh? Can't you tell?
I'm punishing him.
Punishing him for toying with my feelings!
What the hell?
You're the one who's being unreasonable!
Well, at least he's okay...
Leave us alone!
This is none of your business!
Right back at you, stupid.
Why don't you make yourself scarce?
Why are you injured?
Huh?
Oh, I was training... Got a problem with it?
I'll injure you some more!
Palm...
Don't bother.
I could dodge your knife in my sleep.
I was so sure he was dead...
Wait!
I'll kill you!
What?
Catch us if you can, stupid!
Wait!
Stop, Killua...
You're just making her angrier.
Huh?
If we ditch her here, we'll never see her again.
We just have to call Knuckle and tell
him we'll meet him somewhere else.
I'm going back.
Do you want to die?
If you let your guard down,
thinking she's not much of a fighter,
she'll stab you in the back!
She wouldn't do that.
Huh?!
Bu— Didn't you see her take that knife to me?
Damn, you're too much!
They're making a fool of me!
They think they've escaped me?
Fools!
Wherever you run to, I will know!
Cute, cute mermaid...
Where is that accursed brat, Killua?
There he is, the fool!
The hotel by the station...
Brat...
Brat! Brat! Brat!
He keeps interfering!
If not for him, everything would be fine.
I'll chase him to the end of
the world and eliminate him!
Make a fool of me, will you?!
Kno—
Knov-sama...
Where did those boys go?
R-Right...
They went to the hotel that
has a logo with three circles.
This is Knov.
They're at the Triple Circle Hotel.
Yeah, we just got a call from them.
Um, I believe you had planned
to arrive in two days...
No, we're on schedule.
We'll use the extra two days
to observe those boys,
to determine if they're ready to
see Kite in his current state.
But first things first, Palm!
Y-Yes?
It appears that you used your
power without my permission.
I told you to await my orders,
in case of unforeseen events.
Yes...
Your blood is an irreplaceable commodity.
Irreplaceable?
Use it only for me.
Only for Knov-sama...
Understood?
Y-Yes.
Knov-sama really is the only one for me!
And why are you dressed like that?
Oh! No reason...
N-Nothing's going on!
Irreplaceable...
Then tell her to wait until
Kite's back to normal.
I did.
Gon Freecss, age 12, blood type B,
forced into a relationship by Palm
Siberia, age 22, blood type A...
and dumped before he knew it.
Meh... Again?
That's the third one.
Oh! A secret one!
Huh? Really?
Yeah, you can auction it on
the net for a lot of money.
Then you can have it.
Not interested.
Did something happen?
Hmm? Not really.
Let's hit the gym.
Okay!
Well?
Oh, I haven't noticed anything.
They seem to be doing fine...
But we should continue to observe them.
That will give them time to
conclude their business.
While Knov and Shoot were observing
the mental state of Gon and Killua...
He's here.
Who's this guy?
Not bad.
He's fast.
You're faster than the guys
I fought yesterday.
But not by much.
Next time: Grudge x And x Dread.
Give me more meat!
You eat a lot.
Bitter much?
You mean, "Jealous much?"
﻿Looks like you guys have been
waiting here to kill me.
Sorry, but the prey is about
to become the predator.
You'll die before you can even strike back.
Really?
I barely felt a thing.
You could punch us like that a few
thousand times without killing us.
I get it.
You're trying to act tough.
You're swinging long after the ball's
already in the catcher's mitt.
Just as a warning, I'm not
using my full strength.
I can run faster and throw harder punches.
This is a surprise.
He's actually aiming for my face.
I was certain his eyes couldn't
even follow my motion earlier...
Just a lucky guess?
Him, too...
He's clearly ascertaining where
I'm going to be before he attacks.
It's only been a minute since I encountered them.
They've adapted to my speed that quickly?
They're nothing like the guys from yesterday.
How amusing...
It makes this more of a challenge!
Grudge x And x Dread
Your bodies can't keep up with your minds...
You obviously can't compete physically.
How are you gonna compensate?
With guns? Numbers?
We'll use wit and experience.
Where did this stuff come from?
Smoke? Gas?
Poison gas?
Or sleeping gas?
No, they're standing within it.
This must be some kind of special power.
Are you scared?
You can retreat if you want.
Does that mean you aren't running away?
Then this is a smokescreen.
They'll use it as cover for their attack.
Well, let's see what they can do...
Here it comes!
What?
When you use Gyo, your body freezes briefly.
This trick won't work on the same
opponent too many times.
But it only needs to once.
I wouldn't be so sure.
That didn't hurt at all.
I'll admit that you caught me off-guard,
but you didn't do any damage.
What's this?
Gee, I wonder...
It's time.
Adding interest.
Answer me.
Answer me!
Your anger is blinding you
to your surroundings...
It'll be super easy to send you tumbling.
Hey! Damn it!
They're gone?
Where are you?
It's time.
Adding interest.
It doesn't matter what your power does.
I just have to rip you apart!
Looks like he's powerless against Zetsu.
Well, we're dealing with
a level-one soldier ant.
With APR on him, we can easily track him.
We just need to chase him down,
box him in, and that'll be the end.
But doesn't your ability lose its effect
if the target moves too far away?
It'll stop adding interest,
but the effect will remain.
Once I'm back in range,
the counter will start up again.
But even if IRS doesn't kick in,
he'll be easy to finish off.
We've already learned his attacks.
You fool!
We may know what pitch he'll use,
but we still can't put the bat on the ball.
Let's leave him for a Nen user who's
better equipped to handle him.
You're right.
I'm more concerned about Gon and Killua...
Damn...
I can't shake this thing.
I can't outrun it...
So this is Nen.
I need more than just speed here.
Kite's in here.
He is no longer the person you once knew.
It's okay.
We'll find a way to cure him!
Hotel Rafflesia...
Hotel Rafflesia:
Dark Inn
Once I've dealt an enemy a
certain amount of damage,
I'm able to trap
an entire body or merely a single part inside.
This must be how he took my eye.
If I release him from the cage,
he'll return to his original size.
Be careful.
He cannot use Nen, but he is still strong.
Kite...
Most likely, they used him to train soldiers.
He automatically attacks
anyone who approaches.
Kite...
It's okay now.
It's okay.
It's been a while...
since you punched me.
That hurt a lot...
You're going to let this beating continue?
Gon can't use Nen to defend himself either, right?
It's okay, Gon will notice.
Maybe he already has,
and is still...
Perhaps.
He's suppressing his reflexes to dodge or block,
allowing himself to be hit.
For real?
Kite's attacks may be robotic
and easy to anticipate.
But Gon shouldn't be able to adapt
so quickly in his current state!
I'm sure he doesn't know what else to do.
This is the reality we've created
that we must now face.
He'll go right next.
Right again.
And then left.
Then a feint...
He really does fight like a robot.
Kite isn't this weak...
Kite's punches
hurt much more!
I'm sorry, Kite.
It's our fault you're like this...
Get some rest.
We'll take it from here.
Level two...
Gon can't see that thing,
but it activates when anyone touches Kite.
You must be highly skilled at
combat to clear this test.
I've already blocked Kite's Nen,
so that belongs to whoever's controlling him.
Be careful.
If you touch him again, he'll attack.
What do I do?
How did you stop him?
We injured him badly.
We had no choice, but I'm still sorry.
If you stay away, he won't attack.
Kite...
Just wait a little longer.
I'll get you back to normal soon.
Killua...
I want that one myself!
Killua...
I knew something was different when I saw you.
What did you guys do in the
short time since I saw you last?
We didn't do anything.
Our enemies did.
A Few Weeks Later
Twenty-nine days have passed
since Gon lost his Nen.
Are you sure we should let them come along?
We'll be breaking our promise to the old man.
I see no problem with that.
The test was to determine
who would enter NGL...
And we are headed to the
Republic of East Gorteau.
Sounds like a technicality to me.
Then you think we shouldn't bring them with us?
No, they're grown tigers now.
They can take care of themselves.
I would agree that Killua is capable,
but what about Gon?
At the very end, I was impressed
by the way he moved.
But he hasn't shown any fire since.
And he clearly isn't focused during training.
I believe his performance is quite inconsistent.
But he's consistently inconsistent.
He only gets serious when he absolutely must.
I think his lack of drive these past few
weeks will actually give him a boost.
A boost?
He's been saving up all that energy...
To unleash when he finds his hated foe.
Well, we'll see soon enough.
Tomorrow, Gon's Nen will return...
And the enemy is before us!
Near the Republic of East Gorteau Border
What is the agenda behind
the sudden flurry of activity
recently observed in East Gorteau?
Supreme Leader Diego has personally invited
all citizens to gather in the capital city,
Peijing, to celebrate the
nation's birth in ten days.
Yes, there have been occasions
in the past during which
all citizens were invited to participate.
However, we've never seen
anything on this scale,
where practically every citizen,
from babies to the ill, has been summoned
for a celebration spanning three days.
The logical conclusion would be that
the goal this time is different.
What do you believe the goal to be?
Well, it would send a powerful message
if he were to announce his successor
and abdication simultaneously.
But I find it hard to imagine the Supreme
Leader relinquishing his power.
It may also be meant to distract
from some other matter.
In any event, the whole world will be
watching East Gorteau in ten days.
Next...
Colt believes the celebration
will be used as a screening.
We don't know what they'll do
with those found to have Nen,
but ninety-nine percent of
the humans there will die.
We must stop it before that happens!
Our time limit is ten days.
What's the old man up to?
He sent an e-mail saying that he's
already inside East Gorteau,
but I haven't heard from him since.
Do you think he's been taken out?
If he fails to contact us today,
we've been told to assume as much.
Speak of the devil, it's the Chairman.
That old man's got some sharp ears...
He already knows everything.
Including the fact that you boys are here.
And that Morel-san is badmouthing him.
Divide into three pairs and draw the
Royal Guard away from the King.
The night before the celebration,
the operation will begin at midnight.
From the sharp-eared old man.
That guy really scares me...
I'm sorry to say that your thirty days are up.
So I'll make myself scarce!
See you around...
Bye!
Okay, now you can use Nen again.
Give it a try.
Gon...
Sorry, but I'm still not convinced
we should keep you around.
Show me your resolve.
Attack me as if I were responsible for Kite.
If your attack is too weak, we'll replace
you with another Hunter.
Seriously, the master can be so difficult.
He already agreed to bring Gon along...
Gon, show him your Jajanken.
You want me to attack you for real?
Don't insult me!
If you hold back in the slightest,
you're off the team!
Got it.
First comes rock...
Gon,
that's enough...
Right, big guy?
Y-Yeah...
Oh.
K-Killua, thank you.
Sorry about that, Morel-san!
I was really about to kill you!
You got me... You got me good.
You go crazy with the best of them.
We'll split up now.
Use whatever means you deem
best to fulfill your mission.
Gon and Killua, as you requested,
you're assigned to Neferpitou.
Knuckle and Shoot, you're on the
one called Menthuthuyoupi.
Knov and I will take Shaiapouf.
Best of luck to you.
The preparations for the final
battles are complete.
Ten days remain until that moment.
Next time: A x Lawless x Home.
Wanna see what being controlled is like?
Huh?
Stick this antenna here...
Huh?
It has to be Killua.
﻿Next is the continuation of
our report on the UMAs,
or Unidentified Mysterious Animals,
that have recently been sighted.
The difference between this and our previous
report is the increasing number of victims,
and the amount of evidence supporting
the existence of these creatures.
In any case, many of the witnesses are
active members of the police force.
And over half of the officers
who have rushed to the scenes have
been killed by these creatures.
These are images of unidentified creatures
that have been attacking the police.
You can see the victims on the
ground at the creatures' feet.
What we know is that all these creatures
are violent, capable of speech,
and show no fear of humans.
A prime example is this interview
with the lion man of Nevaska.
He spoke at length of a crude theory
about the existence of a kingdom.
The woman interviewing him listened
patiently to what he had to say,
but eventually, she asked the
question on every viewer's mind.
Can you prove that you
truly are what you claim?
Those were her last words.
So far, the unidentified creatures
have only appeared on the Yorbian continent.
But it seems likely that they
will continue to spread,
and no effective method of dealing
with them has been found.
Sorry for the wait.
Okay, let's go.
A x Lawless x Home
They're known as Chimera Ants.
I know.
They became that way after mixing with humans.
Working backwards from the dates and
locations of sightings and police reports,
they probably originated in the Balsa Islands.
Lots of strange nations are in that area.
You shouldn't be talking about
how strange other people are.
But they were once ants...
So they should just stay close to their nest.
Why come all the way out here?
No idea.
Maybe they were just wandering, or perhaps
they were drawn to the smell of garbage.
It can't be a coincidence.
Both NGL and East Gorteau are nations
that share no information with the outside world.
Just like this place.
That makes it easier for them to invade.
It's been quite a long time.
The place hasn't changed...
What's the situation?
Between the victims and martyrs,
we're seeing over three hundred dead.
Bombs have no effect, so we can't fight back.
The council is still arguing about
how to classify the dead.
What do you mean?
A few days ago, this was an ordinary human.
The Ants did this?
Looks dead to me.
What's the problem?
Some are alive and working with the Ants.
And all of them look like monsters.
The council's debate is whether
to declare them dead based on
whether or not there's a way to
restore them to their original forms.
They can't avenge them because
they're too busy arguing over
whether they're dead or mutated?
Nothing's changed.
They always lose sight of what's important.
We're going to do things our way.
If anyone interferes, we'll take them down.
Don't worry.
Before the day is out,
we'll exterminate this so-called Queen.
I am the Queen.
I repeat.
Surrender.
Those who resist will be executed.
The chosen will live in paradise for eternity!
Our mother's greatest flaw
was that she could only produce soldiers
through the archaic and inefficient laying of eggs.
Her sole achievement
was giving birth to me.
Stop...
Kill me!
Kill me!
Plenty of spirit...
He shows promise.
Bingo.
Chosen one, welcome to paradise.
Swear eternal fealty to the Queen.
I am the Queen.
Sexy Stinger of Rebirth
With my Queen Shot, I shall control the world.
Let's go through the front door.
No objection here...
No one's around.
Are they inviting us in?
Then I'll go this way.
I'll take this way.
We're splitting up?
Of course... It's a race to see
who'll kill the Queen.
I imagine you'd prefer to hide
your abilities from us.
Kill anything that attacks you.
If you kill the Queen, you're the interim boss.
Understood.
Start!
They've scattered.
From their footsteps, I can sense
that these intruders are special.
They are accustomed to living in the wild.
Are they strong?
Yes.
Then go and greet them.
But then, no one will be here to guard you.
If you're worried about me,
capture the enemy and hurry back.
I have faith in you, Pike.
Y-You are too kind...
I will serve you with my life!
Off I go!
Now, then...
You're heading out?
My mother's greatest misfortune
was that she never experienced
the joy of combat.
You're no fun...
Let me hold you.
I'll send you to heaven.
Moles.
No, holes?
Bonolenov descended from a small tribe
that industrialization had driven out of
its ancestral lands, the Gyudondond.
When Gyudondond males reach the age of three,
needles are used to puncture holes in their body.
Depending on the holes' size and shape,
and the movements the Gyudondond
make, they can produce sound.
Before fighting rival tribes or wild animals,
they would play a battle song using
their own bodies as instruments.
They are known as the Bapu, dancing warriors.
Bapu
Dancing Warriors
They believe the more beautiful
the sound produced, the stronger
the spirit that descends.
The most skilled Bapu are treated as gods,
and hold more influence than the elders.
Transform this melody into strength to fight!
Battle Cantabile
Battle Cantabile...
Prologue
Prologue!
The blood of my tribe,
the most beautiful in battle,
flows through my veins.
I swear on the names of the spirits and my tribe
that you will not best me.
Was that attack supposed
to hold your tribe's pride?
If so...
You must not feel much pride.
Don't bother recanting those words.
They are but a beast's ramblings.
They cannot affect me!
In a one-on-one fight, my opponent's
strength doesn't matter.
If I can pierce it with this, I'll win.
But I'm not certain I can pierce that...
Those are sharp...
I'll need to slip in between them
and insert the antenna into the joint
exposed when he moves the arm.
Chance of succeeding unscathed...
Twenty percent!
Okay, it worked...
Ow.
Guess escaping unharmed wasn't possible.
Huh?
Why didn't it work?
I put the antenna in...
You must be a Manipulator.
I can tell because, once you placed
that antenna in Pell, you relaxed.
That must be the condition
for activating your power.
You let your guard down
when you thought it worked.
Its name is Pell?
You must also be a Manipulator.
If my power doesn't activate after
the condition has been met,
that means my target is already being
manipulated by another Nen user.
That, and he has a remote controller.
Oh, you knew?
Yes, it's first come, first served for Manipulators.
Once I take you to the Queen, my job is done.
No good...
I can't break free.
Guess there's no choice.
I'd rather not have to use this...
Your punch stings about as
much as a mosquito bite.
What's next?
You gonna kick me?
Pull out a weapon?
As a gift to you on your way to the afterlife,
I'll grant you one more attack.
For an ant, you know some big words.
Then I'll take you up on that...
And go with a punch.
You're sure? Really?
Fifteen should do it.
Fifteen?
Four, five, six...
Eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen...
Fifteen!
Huh?
I get a free attack, right?
W-Wait!
Karmic Loop
Every time I wind my arm, my punch gets stronger.
Ripper Cyclotron!
Ripper Cyclotron
Oh, half of that would have been enough.
I never seem to know how much power to use.
Now, then...
Which way to go?
Right?
Or left?
I'll flip a coin.
What's going to happen to me?
You'll become a slave.
You'll work for the Queen until you die.
Not too different from your current life.
That's true, in a sense.
I'd just be taking orders from a different person.
But I'd rather die than listen
to someone I don't even like.
Strong words.
Well, at this point, all you
can move is your mouth.
I can move both hands and my left leg.
That's nice.
Anyway, ready for me to take control?
I can't let you die.
Once I put this in you...
When I fight, I always carry two antennae.
For just this kind of situation.
First come, first served.
He stuck it in himself!
Autopilot on.
S-So much aura...
Enemy identified.
Eliminating now.
Go, Pell!
Aim for his leg! Remove the antenna!
Mission complete.
Autopilot disengaging.
Powering off.
Ow...
I already feel it...
I'll be down with muscle aches
for two or three days.
That's why I hate using this!
It makes me stronger, but there's a hefty price.
And I remember nothing that happened,
so I don't feel like I've accomplished anything.
You have considerable power for a lady.
Where was she hiding that vacuum cleaner?
His thread is strong.
If I get caught in it, I won't be able to escape.
Where's the Queen?
Rejoice.
She stands before you now.
That's a lame joke.
Huh? A joke?
You have no manners, brat.
This warrants a hefty punishment.
They are but a beast's ramblings.
Then I'll take you up on that.
When I fight, I always carry two antennae.
It sounds like Feitan found the Queen...
How do I kill her first?
What's this? A child?
Hey, little girl, come over here.
I refuse.
Rejected...
Then I'll come to you.
I'm in a hurry right now.
What's that?
Confetti.
Wind!
That didn't even tickle.
Surrounding me with more paper?
You're wasting your time!
Look.
What? You think that means something?
You really are a stupid kid!
Impossible...
This rope is made of steel!
My fan is made of paper.
Meandering Dance
Meandering Dance.
Look.
Your right arm is next.
An umbrella?
Decent reaction.
A hidden blade?
You like hiding things on you, little boy?
As do you.
When an opponent wears baggy clothing,
it's safe to assume they're hiding something.
What's wrong?
Are you not going to continue your attack?
That is the only way to stop my performance.
You'll pay for this!
Pike...
If I get Pike to use his thread
to tangle up this guy,
he can't make any sound!
Next time, I'll rip you apart!
Your escape is certainly fast...
But not as fast as the speed of sound.
Battle Cantabile...
Jupiter
Jupiter!
Crushed to death.
An appropriate death for a bug.
The Phantom Troupe fight to save their home,
Meteor City, from the Chimera Ants.
Next time: Carnage x And x Devastation.
!aulliK, yalp s'teL
.noG, eurS
What did we just say?
Hint... It was backwards.
﻿They can't avenge them because
they're too busy arguing over
whether they're dead or mutated?
Nothing's changed.
They always lose sight of what's important.
We're going to do things our way.
If anyone interferes, we'll take them down.
Don't worry.
Carnage x And x Devastation
The Chimera Ant Zazan has
built her nest in Meteor City.
Calling herself the Queen,
she seeks to conquer the world.
The ones who have risen to quell her
ambitions are inhabitants of this city...
The Phantom Troupe.
Where's everyone else?
Beats me...
Maybe still playing around?
Rather than obliterating my opponent,
I should have enjoyed myself...
That took longer than expected...
I should break my habit
of beating my targets to a pulp.
You're no match for me!
Come back when you're stronger.
Fair point.
My, you took that well.
Looks like I've lost my touch.
But this is a perfect opportunity to practice.
I'm stuck on defense...
He's fast, and has twice as many limbs.
I need to create an opening.
Again?
Now I'm certain...
The moment I think I'm rid of it,
she pulls that vacuum cleaner
out of nowhere again.
Her power lets her pull out
and store objects at will?
I see... Very interesting...
And I can't catch her with my sticky webs.
This girl is good,
but I can't let her get away.
This technique is a literal pain in the ass.
But I have no choice!
Love Shower!
Radiating Love
Uh-oh, there may be no way out of this one...
If I keep the webs coming, you can't escape...
Lucky me!
Caught you!
It's no use...
Even Bihorn-sama, strongest among us,
couldn't snap these webs.
Now, then...
I'll hand you over to Zazan-sama.
Will Zazan-sama praise me?
It got lighter?
Impossible—
How?!
How did she escape?
Huh?
I get it...
You ditched your clothes.
I understand.
She widened an opening in my web to
slip through, while protecting her skin.
With her power, it's feasible.
She left her vacuum cleaner in the web...
But after escaping, she can make it
disappear and call it to her again.
However!
Now that you've removed your clothes,
you can't use the same trick again!
The same applies to you.
I've learned the range and speed of your webs.
And I won't mention that his anus
twitches twice before he fires.
You won't catch me again.
I'll keep my distance.
Blinky and I have won.
Won?
Such a stupid girl...
You can't do anything while running away.
I said that I'll keep my distance,
but I didn't say anything about running.
I'll show you the difference.
Blinky...
Suck every last drop of blood from his body.
What... Wh-Wh-What?
Stop it!
H-Hey...
Y-You little...
Weakling!
Uh-oh, this is bad...
I'm getting dizzy.
I have to stop the blood loss!
(How's that?)
(Now you can't suck my blood...)
There's more?
From here?
And here?
I... I can't block everywhere!
You're bleeding from twenty-nine different wounds.
Based on currently available information,
it's impossible for you to cover
each wound with your eight limbs...
Not without another ace in the hole.
All cleaned up.
Huh?
Hmm...
Ah, you know those webs
you were shooting out?
By covering your body with them,
couldn't you have stopped the bleeding?
We're both pretty stupid...
What is this?
How can they move so fast?
Looks like he's moving a little better now.
He has a ways to go before
he's back to full strength.
They were already here, enjoying the show.
I wasted some time fooling around,
but I was by no means slow...
Five?
No, seven?
How many feints was that?
And how can he leap from
that position while attacki—
Ah! He's already over there!
I can't believe it...
He's on a completely
different level.
Whoa, everyone's already here?
Going for a new look?
I got caught in my opponent's webs.
Wait, you actually lost—
I won.
She's really mad!
Feitan's the only one left.
His opponent's pretty strong.
It's probably the Queen.
But Feitan looks sluggish.
He isn't back to full strength yet...
We know! You already said that!
I'm still too weak.
Behind me?
What's with this guy?
He keeps getting faster?
And more of his buddies keep showing up.
Curse those worthless idiots!
All of them were defeated?!
I didn't think your skin would be so tough.
Cur...
Curse you!
How dare you damage my face?!
I'll kill you!
Ko!
She left herself wide open.
I'm not nice enough to overlook that.
Her attack didn't hit him...
No, she sent a little aura with that swing.
Feitan's idea to use Ko backfired.
After focusing his aura into one point,
he didn't expect to deal no damage.
The miscalculation left him a second
late guarding with his Nen.
In other words, he was basically defenseless.
A puny Emitter attack could
have dealt serious damage.
She knows how to use her aura.
She has good reason to call herself Queen.
This body has no weaknesses!
Shouldn't we help him?
Huh? Why?
This is a race...
If he loses, the next person gets to try.
Who's up next?
We use order of arrival.
That's me, then.
Wait...
We both arrived at the same time.
Fool, I was waiting until you finished your fight.
Now, now... We'll flip a coin to decide.
S-Something's...
wrong with them!
Heads.
Then if Feitan's defeated, I go next.
Bah.
I was naïve...
I thought I could become
number two in no time.
But I'm utterly outclassed...
It's hopeless.
But I won't give up.
I'm used to toughing it out.
All for the sake of retrieving my brother,
no matter how long it takes.
There goes his left arm.
Fei, wanna trade places?
"Piece of crap..."
"Know your place."
Crap, run for it...
You're gonna get caught in it.
When he snaps, he'll hit
everything around him!
We tried to watch him once
before and almost died.
His power has a huge range,
and activates with his anger,
so it knows no restraint.
If you get caught up in the
one he's using this time,
you're dead, Kalluto.
This time?
The attack has other forms?
Darn, I want to see!
What?
When did he put that on?!
Wait... More importantly,
he's much stronger now!
"Now I return your pain."
Feel the heat...
Pain Packer
Unforgiven
Pain Packer!
Rising Sun.
Burnt by the Sun
"Is it hot?"
"Throat too scorched to even breathe?"
"You could try to run."
"Assuming you can even move..."
"What's wrong?"
"Make use of that tough body you're so proud of."
Impossible...
I am the Queen...
I cannot die here...
Out of fuel already?
And the heat wasn't that strong...
How unfortunate...
You could have had a quicker death
if you'd dealt me more damage.
Well, you only have yourself to blame.
They didn't revert after the Queen's death...
But they're no longer under the Queen's control.
Ple... ...me...
Please... ki...
Please... kill... me...
Please...
Kill us...
Hell, no.
I don't do mercy killings.
Attack me, trash!
You were living in this place, right?!
Have the guts to defend it to the end!
You can die with a bang!
Now those geezers
are arguing over whether to exact
revenge upon the real queen.
Man, I'm sick of those idiots.
All they do is sit around a table,
squawking about doing the impossible.
But you're still sticking around, right?
There's nothing else for me to do.
If more Ants show up,
I'll wipe them out at once.
So I don't have to do any more cleanup.
Is it the boss?!
No, it's Nobunaga.
He's asking if we'll help with his job.
What was that?
No way, fool!
Man, this sucks.
I hate having to wait.
Phinks, you sound like some girl with a crush.
He's being very feminine.
Eh?
What was that, bastards?!
Say that again...
I'll kill you!
Hey! We're hurt!
The Phantom Troupe has saved Meteor
City from the Chimera Ant invasion.
Meanwhile...
Gon and Killua are preparing to
infiltrate the Republic of East Gorteau.
The selection of citizens to present
to the King by his own guards...
...will begin in nine days.
Next time: Infiltration x And x Selection.
Meleoron the Chameleon.
Meleoron the Chameleon.
Meleoron the Chaleleron!
Meleoron the Chameleon...
Meleoron the Chameleon!
﻿To become kings, the Chimera Ants
have spread across the world,
committing acts of utmost
tyranny wherever they go.
Fearing the damage will spread,
the government asks the Hunter
Association to exterminate them.
Finally, the Hunter Association makes its move.
Ah, is that all?
Infiltration x And x Selection
Sneaking in was easy.
But the question is how to get
close enough to the enemy.
And we can't let just anyone see us, either.
Informants
This country has a powerful
information regulation system that
operates in secret using groups of informants.
Informants?
Yeah, if you discover an enemy spy,
you receive a reward.
If you find evidence of insurgency,
you receive a reward.
If you stop someone from fleeing the
country, you receive a reward.
So the people will do anything for that reward.
And they aren't just after money.
After racking up enough informant points,
the entire group is promoted.
But if someone provides false information
or a member commits a crime,
the entire group is punished.
Carrot and stick, huh?
It's pretty nasty business.
Family members are put in different groups.
So if an entire group tries to escape,
the other family members can be
executed or imprisoned for life.
If a family is caught trying to escape together,
they'll be executed, no questions asked.
For this country's elite to live the good life,
the rest of its citizens must scrape by.
But the media also spreads lies.
Such as that, in other countries,
half the population starves by age ten.
Foreign aid never reaches the needy.
Instead, it's spent on cars, jewels, and missiles.
It's even said that East Gorteau spends
grant money developing nuclear weapons
that become bargaining chips in negotiations
for unprecedented foreign aid increases.
Hey, don't overheat!
I th-think I'm okay...
That was just so complicated...
But you sure know a lot about it.
My brother told me everything.
And he probably heard it from Grandpa.
Your grandpa?
Yeah. Long ago, he infiltrated
the country for a job.
And I've seen similar information
on Hunter websites.
The system is likely still in use.
There's a village.
Yeah... It's not very big.
What do we do?
Sneak in.
Is that a good idea?
We need current information.
Knowing what kinds of clothes they wear or
how to identify someone's rank will help.
They may have certain practices to root out spies.
The more data we have, the better.
Wait here.
It's completely deserted...
Maybe everyone already left for Peijing?
No, something happened here.
And someone's trying to hide it.
Huh?
They did a sloppy job.
They didn't dig deep enough,
so wild dogs got to the bodies.
I'd imagine the entire village is buried here.
What's going on?
This is the true purpose of
the national celebration.
It's a pretense for entire populations of towns
and cities to vanish without raising suspicion.
The selection has already begun.
In hindsight,
it would be tough to summon all citizens to
the capital and make the selection so quickly.
This nation has a population
of around five million.
Clearing out one town or city
at a time is more effective.
In that case, their only concern would
be coworkers or family members
raising a fuss over the missing.
But with the pretext of the national celebration,
no one will find it strange that
they can't contact someone.
In this nation, cell phones aren't allowed,
so if they believe the other party is traveling,
it makes sense that they can't contact them.
The selection will go very smoothly.
The capital city, Peijing, is in the southeast corner.
They only need to attack the farthest
towns first and work their way east.
If each town is told that the government
will assign its people a time to depart,
there won't be any problems regarding
communication between towns.
So, by preventing people from meeting
between towns to travel together,
they eliminate any cause for commotion.
But...
Hmm?
That means
they have to run around the nation
to attack all five million citizens.
Yeah.
If one percent survives, that gives
them fifty thousand soldiers.
No, I mean before that.
There are ten... No, nine days left.
If you wanted to check five
million people in that time,
you'd need a lot of help.
Assuming that one Nen user
can check ten thousand citizens in ten days...
Five hundred Nen users.
Exactly!
You're getting at the fact that there can't
be that many Ants who can use Nen?
Yeah.
I agree, but it probably isn't that hard.
They don't need Nen users to check everyone.
Huh? Why not?
They can use manipulation.
The power that Chimera Ant used...
I'm guessing it can be used
to automate victims or,
like Genthru's power, can probably be
used to control multiple people at once.
Ordinary humans have aura as well,
so the manipulator could force a
victim's aura to concentrate in his fist.
One punch alone could create
an army of fifty thousand.
While leaving four million, nine hundred
and fifty thousand dead in the process.
Well, it isn't all bad news.
If my theory is correct,
causing a commotion to stop their
selection will be simple.
We merely have to pop up,
take out whoever is being controlled,
and cause a panic.
Then we just encourage
the people who escape to
check on other towns nearby.
If the Chimera Ants have sent controlled
puppets, rather than actual Nen users,
taking them down will be a cinch.
We'll just run around, taking them down
one after another, and wreak havoc.
Yeah.
The problem is that they'll detect us quickly.
Once we make our move,
they'll know we're here.
If we want to go with the old man's
plan, we should stay hidden.
What do you think?
Let's do it.
If the selection has already begun,
we can't just stand around watching.
Okay, let's do it.
Uh-huh!
But I'll do this alone.
Huh?
You stay in hiding.
Why?
It'll go better if we bothâ€”
Don't forget our main mission!
Defeating that Chimera Ant.
That should be your focus.
Let me handle everything else.
I'll stir things up.
And no offense, but I work more easily alone.
Jeez... Fine, I got it.
Really?
Huh?
Do you really understand?
Killua?
Promise me you won't make a move!
Not even if people are killed
right before your eyes!
Promise!
I'll contact you by text.
Our cell phones should still work in this area.
Killua?
Sorry... It's nothing!
I'm just a little tense.
What's this?
They aren't citizens of this country.
I would expect a couple of kids to be spies.
But they're definitely strong...
Are they assassins?
Are they here to hunt down the King?
Then I can't ignore them...
But I don't want to fight them both at once.
I definitely don't want to fight the
silver-haired one on the left.
Just watching him walk, I can tell he's strong.
As much potential as a Squadron Leader?
That kid is something special.
I completely concealed my presence,
but he still sensed something?
How convenient!
Are you sure about this?
You'll really transport my family
and me to another country?
Do not worry.
We have received official approval,
and prepared the necessary documents.
All that's left is for you to sign the papers.
However, the condition that you share
your complete knowledge of military affairs
in exchange for your freedom is essential.
As mentioned in the agreement,
if you do not keep up your end after signing,
we shall both find ourselves in difficult positions.
That won't be a problem.
I'll tell you everything...
All I know about the atrocities
that Diego has committed.
We appreciate it.
Our lives are on the line, as well.
"That Diego has committed"?
You talk like it doesn't concern you.
The wine you're drinking and
the room you stand in
were earned by following that bastard.
You mean "that we've committed,"
you son of a bitch.
But I get it... We're here on business.
So, Marcos-san...
Continue going about your business as normal.
In two weeks, you and your family
will be relaxing on the beach.
I can't accept it!
We're supposed to stand around,
watching as people are killed?
Are you sleepy?
Want me to put you to sleep, eh?
Calm yourself.
If they're gonna check five
million citizens in ten days,
simple arithmetic says that's
five hundred thousand per day!
Of which one percent will survive!
And your point is?
That means four hundred, ninety-five
thousand have already been killed!
How can you be so calm?
Because if we lose our cool, billions could die!
If the plan fails, everyone dies.
If we can't draw the three Royal
Guards away from the King,
not even the Chairman will
be able to defeat the King.
Thus, we cannot let them discover
our existence before the time is right.
If that happens, security around the
King will be even further tightened.
You must endure this.
You're telling me to sacrifice five
million to save the human race?
That's right.
If blaming me consoles you, go ahead.
But if you don't have a better idea,
don't be too self-righteous.
Damn it...
We must do only what we can.
But we must put our lives on the line to do so.
Yeah...
Is Killua okay?
He was acting a little weird.
Maybe I should have stuck with him?
But if I'd followed him, he'd be mad.
You did well to avoid that.
How about this?
I use my strong tail as a spring,
to propel me among the trees!
In the darkness, following my
movement is impossible!
Caught you!
Now I'm going to crush you!
You're not crushing me!
Huh?
I'm the one who caught you!
He seems to have a snake's genes,
so he should be able to go ten
days without starving to death.
As I thought... He's strong...
But I should continue to observe.
I already let them find me...
I need to hide better.
But it's strange...
Why are there soldiers around if the
selection is already finished here?
Maybe there are extra guards
because we're near the border.
An owl and a bat?
This time, he's facing two...
What will he do?
The Chimera Ants are using
darkness to attack Gon.
And why is Meleoron following him?
Next time: Combination x And x Evolution.
Come on down, everyone...
I have a perfectly ordinary box,
which has not been touched.
One, two, three!
That would be an illusion.
﻿After Gon parts ways with Killua
in order to stop the selection,
he finds himself under attack
by new Chimera Ants.
An owl and a bat?
They're both nocturnal creatures...
Hunters of the night!
From the left?
Bring it!
The owl's feathers?
Damn...
The bat's wings are so loud,
I can't hear the owl at all!
Combination x And x Evolution
My ears can pick up sounds of
higher frequency than other animals'.
I can hear you stepping on leaves
and your clothes rustling.
All of which tell me exactly where you are!
From the right this time!
The owl uses its feathers to distract me
right before the bat attacks...
They're using both long- and short-range attacks.
Wait...
That means...
He has a lot of aura... But it won't help.
We are unrivaled in the darkness!
I should approach this the opposite way!
If the owl is acting in a support role,
I should focus on the sound of the bat's wings.
Right after the owl attacks,
the bat will attack!
Now!
Bingo!
I missed?
But my timing was perfect!
Ultrasonic waves?
Damn, I missed again?
Bah, he's correctly guessing
the direction of my attacks.
For a human, his ears are sharp.
And his aura keeps growing,
so my feathers aren't doing any damage.
The bat uses ultrasonic waves to
anticipate the timing of my attack.
Unless I find a way to stop it, I can't win!
First comes rock...
His aura continues to grow.
This could pose a problem.
Not at all...
This is our chance.
He's probably using his ultimate attack.
If we can evade it, we've won.
I can use my ultrasonic waves
to see it in advance.
Do you need help?
Wait, I'll try getting closer as quietly as I can.
The sound's moving away.
The sound's gone!
Now, with no wingbeats...
I dive!
That won't work!
Your wings aren't like the owl's,
so I can hear you slice through the air.
Now, show me your ultimate attack.
He isn't acting?
I guess a human can only hear so much.
In that case, I'll make my move...
I'll slash your jugular!
Keep my motions minimal.
Wait until I draw her as near as possible!
He was baiting me?
I'm in trouble.
But his punch will take a
few milliseconds to land.
I have plenty of time to fly away!
The noise...
I can't see.
I must get away!
You won't escape!
Rock...
You aren't the only one that can use sound...
Paper...
...to locate others.
Paper!
All right.
A rock?
He used that to deflect my shot?
Gorilla Mode
That was close...
Damn it!
I used my special attack and
still couldn't bring it down!
What was that?
There was a sound that made my head spin.
Is this ultrasound, too?
That stupid kid has a loud voice...
But I'm much better at attacking with sound!
This is the true power of their combination.
They strike with sound and finish with brawn.
What now?
Do I cover my ears?
No, I can't...
In the darkness, if I handicap my hearing,
my reaction time will suffer.
I know!
Gyo!
His eyes are shining?
Or is that aura?
He'll rely on his eyes, ignoring sound?
Let's give him another...
Ultrasonic Dissonance
Secret Noise!
Okay!
This should help some.
He spit on cloth to make earplugs. Clever...
Water significantly weakens the power of sound!
Good, this is better...
I can locate the owl through its aura.
Here it comes!
A feather?
Zetsu.
Of course... They started off as wild animals.
From birth, they've known
to conceal themselves
when approaching their prey!
I can fend off their attacks,
but the ultrasound really hurts.
If I don't keep up the Gyo,
they'll take me down before
I can even find them!
In terms of latent aura,
the kid has a clear advantage.
Even after being hit all those times,
he's taken no damage.
But his level of capability is irrelevant.
Without a strategy, he's just a moving target.
They work in perfect sync.
I have to disrupt that!
Ah, he thinks that if he's right on top
of me, we can't use ultrasound.
Wrong guess!
If I use Rock, I can defeat this one.
But then the bat might run
and warn the other Ants!
To me, a starry night is as bright as day.
As long as I'm not in total darkness,
I can see you without needing
to rely on my hearing!
So if I cover my ears...
I can attack at will!
The kid has shrouded his entire
body in aura to avoid damage.
But that reduces the strength of his attacks,
making it impossible to stand against them.
At this rate, he'll never defeat them...
It's over for this kid.
Their weakness is that
their movements are always in sync!
Here!
They always take positions on opposite sides
to avoid both being targeted at once.
When the owl is in front of me,
the bat is directly behind me!
A giant wall?
The real wall was
behind me...
He turned our teamwork against us?
If I only have one opponent,
I can concentrate on attacking.
Once he pulls off one plan,
things will go his way...
But that attack won't be enough
to get him anywhere here.
Damn!
First comes rock...
Rock... Paper...
Why, you...
Rock!
I made sure to knock you west!
Go back to NGL!
That was incredibly strong...
I see... This is his real ultimate attack.
I take back what I said.
This kid can be useful.
But how do I proceed?
Diego has been dethroned.
Brainwashed soldiers are running around,
slaughtering entire villages and towns!
Diego has fallen?
Is that true?
But we all saw the soldiers try to kill everyone.
There's no time to think about it!
Just leave this village and run, anywhere!
Warn people in other areas!
Who's interfering?
It was in the southeast this time.
Some of my puppets have been stopped.
That was fast.
Whoever they are, they're keeping
low and unpredictable.
An assassin?
But they are acting on their own...
A decoy?
This is so annoying...
I wanna kill them!
It is no more than a diversion.
Which means we cannot go.
You think?
But it doesn't feel like the purpose is to bait us.
They're being careful not to let me catch them...
It may all be an act to draw you out.
But perhaps I'm over-thinking things.
But... But...
Ah, how I long to indulge myself
in the delight of agonizing...
It is the sweet trap of the thought process.
Nothing more.
The answer is simple.
Our mission is to protect the King.
We can let the other Ants handle the rest.
Is it our turn?
When we were injured
and on the run from the Hunters, you took us in.
You even gave us instruction on using our power.
It is time for us to return the favor!
Someone's running around
and disabling my puppets.
Can you kill them?
You can count on me.
Take this cell phone.
We can't use telepathy.
I'll give you updates on their location.
Understood.
Can we really trust them?
Nah, I don't trust them.
They're the ones trying to earn our trust,
so they'll try hard to carry out their mission.
It's possible that they're looking for an
opportunity to stab us in the back.
In that case, we should treat them accordingly.
The closest village is at two o'clock.
The next closest villages are
at eight and ten o'clock...
Should I skip them and head for
Taba, forty kilometers away?
Play it safe...
Don't let anyone find me.
I can't go this way.
This is bad...
I should have taken matters into my own hands.
What's wrong?
As we speak, Cheetu is racing
toward East Gorteau.
It seems the Hunters that replaced
us failed to capture him.
Is he headed toward us?
No, if he continues on his current
course, he'll pass far to the south.
Where are you going?
Don't try to stop me...
I'm already in a bad mood.
The Hunter Association has captured three
hundred and nineteen Chimera Ants
outside of NGL as of yesterday.
But Colt confirmed that none of
them were Squadron Leaders.
According to him,
there are eight Squadron Leaders left
that would be considered aggressive.
Hunters have encountered four,
but they all got away.
Cheetu is coming to East Gorteau for a reason.
He must know the King is here.
He's choosing to return to the King's
service in order to increase his power.
My ability is still in effect,
and I have more raw strength.
But if we let him slip away and
he gains even more power,
there's no telling who will win next time.
If we allow more Ants like him to join the King,
we'll never be able to draw the Royal Guard away.
Are you still gonna try to stop me? Eh?
If you are, I'll fight you first.
First, we contact Morel-san.
If worse comes to worst,
he'll need to replace us.
I'll come with you.
This should increase the odds
of capturing that Ant.
It's Knuckle... Something's come up.
Yes, I'd guess so.
Probably.
Yes.
So, uh...
Hello? Hello?
Fools!
I told you to send Riakke!
He'd have been perfect for this.
Huh?!
I don't give a damn!
What's wrong?
The Chimera Ant we were tracking escaped.
The review board didn't send
the Hunter we requested!
Who did they send?
Some Hunter I've never heard of.
Probably an Association dog.
An Association dog...
You mean Hunters who only take jobs
through the Hunter Association.
It isn't surprising that they have less talent.
Damn! I should have gone
to talk to Riakke myself!
Don't be foolish!
If you do anything without board approval,
the Chairman will get all the grief.
He had to argue with the executive
committee just to get the two of us here.
But they don't understand the situation.
They base it on past accomplishments
and donations to the Association...
The review board has always been inflexible.
How can you be so relaxed?!
If we underestimate the Squadron
Leaders, we'll pay dearly for it.
They're strong.
After all, they listen to their deepest desires.
So they have the talent to quickly master
the abilities they need the most.
If we let the review board bring self-preservation
and formality in, we won't get help in time.
Maybe that's their goal...
You refer to the rumors that
the Vice-Chairman's faction
controls the review board?
That they're only giving work to Hunters
who agree to vote for him in the next election?
There's no evidence of anything
like that happening.
You think they're stupid enough to get caught?
Look at the facts!
They've let every Squadron Leader
they've faced escape alive!
If this expedition fails,
the Chairman will shoulder the blame.
They're willing to do whatever it
takes to guarantee that result.
As the Chimera Ants claim more victims,
the voices calling for the Chairman's
resignation grow louder.
Too bad the voices belong to a bunch
of people sitting at their desks!
If we take out the King and five million
people are already dead, we've failed!
We already knew that.
The Chairman is prepared.
When he developed this plan, he was
well aware of the consequences.
He knew how long assuring victory would take,
and the resulting casualties...
Five million is the low end...
That's too high!
Marcos-san?
What?
The phones have been ringing nonstop!
Rumors of a coup d'Ă©tat are flying around.
And it's been discovered that mass murders
are taking place all over the nation.
This is no rumor. It's actually happening!
What's going on here?
Are you responsible for this?
We haven't done anything!
The citizens have learned the
truth about the selection?
We'll discuss this later.
Return to the office before anyone suspects you.
Morel!
Our beloved leader, Diego, has an
urgent announcement to make.
To ensure that our great leader's message
will be heard throughout the nation,
we request that relay speakers in all
regions be turned to maximum volume.
All televisions and radios should be on,
and the volume raised to maximum.
Good evening, my beloved comrades.
I am Diego.
I have just declared that East
Gorteau is under martial law.
This precaution is being taken to combat
malcontents that would foment rebellion.
I ask all comrades to stay indoors,
with your doors locked.
Anyone outdoors without permission will
be identified as a rebel and punished.
I ask that you not lend an ear
to false rumors being spread,
but that you follow my instructions.
The soldiers of my special forces
will be visiting your residences,
to see if any rebels are hiding inside.
Do not open your doors for anyone else.
Their response was too fast.
It must be Killua and Gon.
They weren't supposed to act.
But this must be part of the Chimera Ants' plan.
They were so well-prepared,
I can't believe otherwise.
The citizens learning the truth about
the selection wasn't important.
In fact, if they did, the military
would have an excuse to mobilize.
East Gorteau has been placed under martial law,
completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Hmm... No problem.
You can bring out tanks and fighter jets.
I will stop them all.
Next time: Tracking x And x Pursuit.
98!
99!
100!
We want to thank everyone...
...for helping us reach 100 episodes!
Thank you!
We hope you keep watching!
﻿Someone's running around
and disabling my puppets.
Can you kill them?
You can count on me.
Hmm... No problem.
You can bring out tanks and fighter jets.
I will stop them all.
Tracking x And x Pursuit
Knuckle and Shoot are on the
move to capture Cheetu
as he attempts to return to the King.
He's close.
Okay.
He's following the road.
If he continues on it,
he'll pass by in ten minutes.
Do you think he'll stick to the road?
No, he'll notice my presence
just before he gets here.
Because APR will start adding interest again.
But given his speed...
We may be able to attack him
just before APR adds interest.
I Alone Lose When It Reaches the Heavens
Chapter 7 Bankruptcy
Knuckle's ability, Chapter 7 Bankruptcy,
attaches APR to an enemy.
Every ten seconds, APR informs the
enemy that interest will be added.
But if the enemy is over a hundred meters
away from Knuckle, the interest stops.
When this happens, the time
until the next interest payment
is remembered by APR.
Once the enemy is back within
Knuckle's hundred-meter range,
APR picks up where it stopped.
He's approaching at a speed between
160 and 180 kilometers per hour.
If there are still three seconds or more
before APR adds interest again,
there's a good chance we can
attack before he notices us.
Here he comes!
What's wrong?
Damn, what happened?
At the last second, he suddenly changed direction!
He's down below!
Knuckle...
Don't bother. We can't catch up.
Our opponent has a cheetah's speed.
He isn't supposed to know
how to deal with Zetsu.
How did he discover our ambush?
Could it be...
We're slightly downwind.
The breeze is blowing this way
with no change in direction.
So he didn't smell us.
Look up!
What's that?
I've discovered two suspicious figures.
What should I do?
Ignore them. They aren't the target.
No point in doing more work than necessary.
Yes, sir.
It appears they were trying
to ambush Cheetu-sama.
Oh, he's in the area?
I warned Cheetu-sama before he ran into their trap.
Was that unnecessary?
What did Cheetu do?
He took a detour toward the capital.
He told me to thank you for the help.
I see, good work.
He owes me now.
This is Leol.
The target just engaged a squad of
soldiers in the city of Longtong.
Longtong?
Head north and try to cut it off.
Just a hunch.
Understood.
Looks like even the army can't handle this.
No... Well, they're only there to buy time.
They've had to stay in one area
for a longer period of time.
After all, it's been moving constantly
for over thirty hours.
Diego has fallen into enemy hands!
If you stay in your homes, you'll be killed!
Liar!
Rebel scum!
Damn... Diego just appeared on TV,
looking alive and well.
The odds are against me now.
I'll have to give up my instigation.
My only option is to take out as many
puppets and soldiers as I can!
Should I go north next?
I knew it.
Someone's still following me!
Who's there?!
If you want something, show yourself!
The presence has completely vanished.
It might be following me until
more Chimera Ants show up.
I'm gonna shake it!
It can't outlast me!
Yo...
Yo.
Sorry for stopping you.
Nah, I was headed this way.
The King's in this direction, right, Hagya?
Yeah, I know. It's Leol now.
Then you did that on purpose?
You're still a bastard.
Flutter's warning was a big help.
Right now, I'm trying to avoid fights...
I'm glad to hear that.
By the way, what's that thing?
No idea.
A Hunter hit me with it.
It follows me wherever I run.
Not sure what to do.
But so far, it doesn't seem to have any effect.
Want me to get rid of it?
Do you want me to get rid of it?
You can do that?
Probably.
But not for free, right?
I'm glad you're so understanding.
Figured.
The Royal Guard has assigned me a mission.
I'd like your help.
Leol-sama...
I've spotted the target.
He's headed north on the road through
the forest northeast of Longtong.
Neferpitou-dono's hunch was right...
Don't let him get away.
Use all your forces to slow him down.
Yes, sir.
We're chasing down a human.
He's probably a Hunter.
And you want me to help hunt him?
You said he's a Hunter?
They can be tough to deal with...
Of course, so I've planned ahead.
Shaiapouf-dono has prepared
a power tailored for you.
He will teach you to use it.
With luck, you can master it in a day.
I'm a slow learner, so mine took me
three days to get the hang of.
Sounds like a sweet deal...
In return, I swear loyalty to the King?
Exactly... Easy enough, right?
Sure, I just wanted an explanation.
You're a sharp fellow.
If you accept, return to the castle,
master your new power,
and then contact me.
In the meantime, I'll have my underlings
determine the target's abilities.
Well, I guess I owe you one.
Might as well.
Anyway, you're still all about stealing glory.
Naturally.
I was once king of the jungle.
Obviously, you're looking to retake the throne.
Damn, I'm being followed.
And he's way out of yo-yo range.
If I don't lose him or defeat him, I'll be in trouble.
There's a jungle over there!
The leaves are dense enough,
he shouldn't be able to see me from the air.
If he descends to follow,
he'll be in range of my yo-yo!
He isn't coming?
Did I lose him?
But in that case, he should
come looking for me.
Damn...
I don't have time to wait around!
Hurry up, already!
You can't hide from me.
Go forth, soldiers of Leol.
Capture your prey!
Something's coming, but from the opposite side,
and it's on the ground!
He removed his foe's head
and arms with one swing!
I can't beat him in a one-on-one,
close-quarters fight...
Where is he?!
Captain! Above you!
I'm gonna die—
I missed two of them!
We're attacking him en masse, in the treetops,
and we can't even touch him!
Retreat!
Time to regroup!
I won't let you escape...
You must be the leader.
I'll eliminate you first!
How'd you like that blast?
That bastard...
He blew a fart at me!
No, there's a bigger problem...
I completely concealed my presence,
and attacked from his blind spot.
But he countered at the perfect time.
Someone must be instructing
him from a distance.
It must be him!
He's probably watching right now.
I'd guess he has a power that
lets him track my location.
In that case...
I can't show him the cards
in my hand, no matter what.
I don't want them to learn
of my lightning or yo-yo!
The ideal scenario would be to lose
them and go back into hiding.
But that's looking impossible.
I'll have to defeat them all without using—
A gun?
No...
There's something stuck to my face...
A flea?
A flea?
Damn!
Where did it come from?!
Area TH-88, X-15, Y-12, Z-2.
Point X-9, Y-3, Z-1.
Okay.
There's no escaping...
from my Fleadom, oh yeah.
Damn!
The bleeding won't stop.
These fleas are more than just big bugs...
Area P-9, Y-7, X-8, Z-4.
Point Y-5, X-3, Z-1.
Okay.
The sniper isn't trying to deal serious damage.
The real goal is to exhaust my
strength through blood loss!
My fleas are very special...
They have a 200-meter vertical leap.
And when you factor in...
my air gun's power,
they become unstoppable, oh yeah.
Oh? He's already able to dodge them?
No wonder those apes couldn't do anything.
If I keep running around, it'll be
harder for them to snipe me!
But I have to conserve stamina.
Ah, he's going to try something.
He may try to use his power.
Let's see what he can do.
Okay.
My Super Eye allows me to observe a target
from multiple angles via my Satellite Dragonflies.
No ability you use can escape my sight.
Now, let's see what you do.
Killua cannot use En.
Expanding his aura around him
and maintaining it for a long time
is by no means his forte.
Killua knows this shortcoming.
And so, he keeps his aura within
the range he can best manage.
A mere fifty-seven centimeters from his body.
Not much room to work with.
In other words, the moment a projectile is
within fifty-seven centimeters of his body,
Killua must rely on his incredible reflexes
and physical strength to react
with desperate speed,
and dodge at point-blank range.
But this time, he didn't dodge!
All to determine the angle of
the projectile's approach.
Damn... It came from this way!
He let himself be hit, so he
could locate the sniper.
The target is quickly heading your way.
Okay.
I somewhat expected this.
The bleeding's stopped anywhere
that the fleas only scratched me.
They must secrete some chemical that
stops blood from clotting naturally.
If I start bleeding in too many
places, I'll be in trouble.
I can't let him escape!
This is perfect.
I can see clearly in every direction.
How do you like this?
There's nowhere for you to hide!
Bring it on!
Wait!
This desert is massive.
If you don't have any water,
you'll die of thirst in a day.
Too bad...
I wanted to observe you a little longer,
but I guess that won't work.
I was running low on stamina, anyway.
I suppose this gives us more
time to talk things over...
Let's begin with introductions.
My name is Jail...
Scratch that, it's Meleoron.
When the Queen was still alive,
I was a Squadron Leader.
Nice to meet you.
What's your name?
Why were you following me?
Because I didn't want to let you get away.
And I certainly couldn't let you die...
Because you'll be a valuable partner.
You have business with the King, right?
I do not!
Huh?
That was dangerous...
He must have a reason for approaching me.
I can't tell him anything.
Really? Aren't you guys here to defeat the King?
"You guys"?
Yep... I've been watching you since
that other kid was with you.
I understand.
And you felt that I would put up
less of a fight than Killua!
Huh? Eh?!
You've got it all wrong!
That's how you interpret it?
I guess it makes sense...
To you, I'd look like an enemy.
I guess I should clear up the misunderstanding first.
Listen up.
I swear that I'm not lying.
I'm not looking to trick or defeat you!
Okay, I believe you.
Of course... It's hard to believe!
I can sympathize.
If I were in your shoes...
Eh?
Is that him?
This is a trap.
You still wanna come?
Couldn't care less.
Die.
He instantly acted to kill me...
No hesitation at all.
I'm impressed!
An underground lake?
Lookin' for a taste of hell?
Here you go!
Blood!
Food!
It's food!
Wait, this is...
Captain Ikalgo's host!
Crap, stop eating it.
I want to stop, but I can't...
The blood is calling to us!
Bastard!
How dare you chop off my precious legs?!
I couldn't let you drag me into the water.
These suction cups saved me.
Anyway, aren't you an octopus?
Don't call me an octopus!
Killua's opponent turns out to be Ikalgo,
a parasitic Chimera Ant, resembling
an octopus, that uses human hosts.
Don't call me an octopus!
Next time: Ikalgo x And x Lightning.
What has eight legs and lives in the ocean?
An octopus.
Don't call me an octopus!
﻿These suction cups saved me.
Anyway, aren't you an octopus?
Don—
Ikalgo x And x Lightning
A mob of assassins attacks Killua after he
and Gon split up to stop the selection.
One of them is Ikalgo,
an octopus Chimera Ant.
Aren't you an octopus?
Don't call me an octopus!
See ya!
I need to find a new host, or
I can't charge up my next shot.
I'll let the Ortho siblings take it from here.
Yo, we meet again.
So we do...
Long time, no see!
Ya know?
Can I ask you something?
Sure, go ahead!
Why didn't you dive underwater to escape?
You should have an advantage in the water.
Don't tell me you can't swim.
Uh, well...
It's the blood, right?
When they smell blood, your
buddies in the water go berserk
and attack the injured, no matter who it is.
With those wounds, if you went in there,
you'd be torn to shreds.
Am I wrong?
Uh, w-well...
I suppose that's one way to...
Ikalgo, did you finish off the kid?
No, we're still fighting!
Who are you talking to?
I screwed up!
Right, you all can communicate via telepathy.
Talking to your boss? It's that guy
who was flying over me, right?
Wait, now look here...
Uh, so...
Hey, Ikalgo! Answer me!
You could say that's what I might be doing...
Yes! We're still fighting!
Oh, sorry to interrupt you.
Let me know if you learn anything.
If he sees dozens of dragonflies
flying around inside a cave,
the enemy would get suspicious...
I won't be able to send my
Satellite Dragonflies inside.
Let's make a deal, then.
If you tell me about his power,
I'll spare your life.
You have ten seconds to answer.
Eight seconds left.
Six seconds.
I wanted to be reborn a squid...
I would've given anything to have
been a Chiroteuthis imperator.
Do you think octopi and squid are similar?
If so, you're mistaken...
Octopi are ugly.
Squid are squidderific.
I think they look divine!
Two seconds.
I won't betray a buddy!
Yeah, I could see that in your eyes.
I can only hope
that in my next life, I'll be born a squid...
Wh—
Why?
Because you're a cool guy.
In different circumstances,
we could've been friends.
You lowered your guard!
Didn't think fish could jump, eh?
I'll crush you and the rock behind you!
Come in, Ikalgo.
Y-Yes, the fight isn't over yet!
Has he used any weapons or special abilities?
Ikalgo!
No, he's been fighting...
with only his bare hands.
Come on... Beg for your life.
Otherwise, it's no fun!
Or are you in too much pain to talk?
Yeah, this is a relief.
Huh?
Fighting scumbags like you is a lot easier.
Huh?
I have no qualms about killing you.
Yep! He was just a scumbag!
That's why he was the decoy!
I did it, Ortho-sama!
I've attached the badge!
Coburn pulled it off!
Time to start the game.
Let's enjoy ourselves.
Damn, the bleeding won't stop...
I need to find an exit.
A digital sound inside my head?
Wha—
What?
A fish? But I'm not in the water!
What's going on?
I didn't sense anything!
Again...
I didn't see anything or sense any
aura until the fish hit me!
What's going on?
This is bad.
I can't tell where the attacks are coming from.
108 points.
You have no idea what's going on?
I should say that you're
hearing my voice in your head.
Well, if you survive long enough,
you'll figure out what's happening.
These are fish made from Nen.
So why can't I sense them?
Something must be triggering
them from somewhere else.
That's the only possible explanation!
How else could I be attacked by
something I can't see or sense?
This is going well...
Well, have you determined
anything about these attacks?
Three...
He can only materialize three fish at once.
After that, the fish will disappear.
And the vivid colors of the
target he put on me...
It can only mean one thing!
Your power involves
darts!
Bingo.
That's correct.
But the great thing about our power
is that figuring it out won't help you.
Because my Nen fish darts
have no physical form until the
instant they pierce your flesh.
That makes it impossible to block them.
Incidentally, your left shoulder is 54 points.
I have a dart board
that's linked to various parts of your body.
For instance...
Your right elbow is 27 points.
Your right hand is 18 points.
99 points...
Hey, what's wrong?
I can't hear your screams.
Are you already dead?
The game's only just begun.
Triple 6!
4!
13!
Bravo!
Brother, that was magnificent.
You're on a roll.
Naturally...
Our lives are on the line...
This is how the Ortho siblings' power works.
The sister creates a Nen badge,
which activates after it's affixed to the target.
That links the target to the dart
board created by the brother.
Until the game ends, no one
can deactivate the badge,
not even the Ortho Siblings.
When the brother's darts hit the board,
the target is attacked by needlefish.
There is no way to avoid this attack.
That is because, until they've
hit the target's body,
the needlefish do not exist.
Thus, it is impossible to sense
them coming or dodge them.
This is our unbeatable power...
Needlefish De Darts!
Death Games
Death Games
Needlefish De Darts
Of course, the siblings incur some risk.
Once the badge activates, they are invincible.
But if the brother misses the board with the
final dart that decides the game's outcome,
all of the damage the target has taken
will transfer to the siblings.
We are invincible. That is because...
We are bound by the
strongest trust in the world.
It isn't over yet...
Well, it seems the game's almost over.
Why don't you tell him that?
No need to be that nice.
If he were pleading for his life,
it'd be easier for me to focus.
Or if he were to give up
and beg me to kill him,
or if he wanted to be a nihilistic hero
and said, "Not a bad way to die."
Those would help motivate me,
as I toss my darts.
But he'll just have to dread his impending
death, never knowing when it will end...
Until he dies.
It's not...
It's not over yet!
Damn...
This looks pretty bad...
I've lost way too much blood.
I could die here,
so no point in saving what's left.
Now, then.
It's my final turn.
Left ear.
That sure gave him a big earring.
Right calf!
Okay, time for the last throw.
My brother, I trust you.
I've got this.
See?
Bravo!
Yay!
Yay!
Yay!
You're the best in the world!
I'll go check his corpse.
I'll come with you.
We should share some of the
meat with Coburn as a reward.
Aren't you gonna eat?
Can I ask you something?
What?
What made you decide to trust me?
It wasn't that I didn't trust you.
I just didn't know why you were following me.
And you swore that you weren't lying.
Huh?! That's it?
Isn't that enough?
Hell, no!
Liars make promises all the time!
A promise is the one thing
you should never trust!
Then you were lying?
I'm different...
I don't lie!
I only tell the truth!
Then it's okay.
I think I'm starting to lose it.
He's strong, but he's just a kid.
I'm putting my fate in the
hands of this clueless boy?
Besides, if you're lying, that'll
actually make things easier for me.
Easier?
I won't have to show you any mercy.
I'll be free to destroy you.
The look... The look in the kid's eyes...
Yes, this is why I had a hunch...
There's something special about this kid.
I can't even tell how much
power he really has...
You hit him right in the forehead.
Flutter-sama, we've taken out the target.
Really? That's excellent.
I will tell Leol-sama that a
promotion is in order.
Thank you very much.
Great!
We can be assistant squadron leaders now!
Yay!
Yay!
Yay!
H-How?
How can you be alive with a dart
sticking out of your brain?!
What?
It's a suction cup from an octopus.
No way.
How did you manage that trick?
No, wait...
My... My darts were perfect!
It's absolutely impossible to stop them!
Yeah, I didn't stop it.
I just grabbed it,
the moment it materialized at my head.
From what you were saying, I could tell
you could hear my voice,
but you couldn't see me.
I had plenty of time to switch out
the needle for a suction cup.
H-Hold on...
No human has reflexes fast
enough to catch a dart!
Well, it wouldn't have been possible had
I not known where it would appear.
But I knew exactly where and
when the last dart would hit.
The final dart must hit the board's
outer ring per double out rules.
And you were playing an 01—501 game.
You start with 501 points,
and the goal is to reach 0.
These rules are used in professional competition.
I n-never told you what rules I was using!
As soon as I knew you were playing darts,
my suspicions were confirmed.
Remember how
your first dart hit double 4?
The game starts by hitting the board's outer ring.
A double in...
A sign that you were confident in your skill.
A skilled player would play by official rules.
Players with talent and confidence
tend to seek public recognition.
After that, I just had to do the
math and endure the pain.
I subtracted your points from 501,
and waited until your score was under 40.
At that point,
I placed my hand in the 40-point area, my forehead.
That's all it took.
To improve his reflexes, Killua changed
his aura into electricity.
When the dart touched his skin,
the sensation did not travel
from his skin to his brain
using the nervous system.
He used Nen to ensure that, as soon
as the aura registered the dart,
it sent a message directly to his
left hand, to grab the dart.
Do you have some history with darts?
At age six, I mastered the game.
I've counted down from 1,440 points.
It was part of my early training.
It's your fault for getting cocky
and talking too much!
Or was I seven?
You're so stupid!
Guess it doesn't matter...
Pipe down! You just stood around and clapped!
I talked too long.
I need to hurry!
Huh?
What?
My body won't do what I tell it to...
Wait, is this really happening?
Wow...
All this is my blood?
It feels like I'm taking a warm bath.
Wait, this isn't the time to think about that...
I should get going.
Crap... Now I feel cold...
Damn...
And after that last fight gave me a hint...
for improving my power.
Am I...
going to die here?
Gon... Sorry...
I wasn't any... help...
Octopus...
Don't call me an octopus!
What are you doing?
Isn't that obvious?
I'm turning traitor.
Lame, huh?
Now stop talking.
I know a secret doctor.
It won't take long by underground waterway.
Don't die before we get there!
Are you an idiot?
I spared... your life...
Now they'll be hunting you...
I know that!
Don't ask me why I'm doing this.
But you know...
After you told me, an octopus,
that I was a cool guy...
After you said we could be friends...
I couldn't let you die!
I'm gonna save you!
Don't die on me!
Next time: Power x And x Games.
If you smoke, your teeth will turn black.
I'm a chameleon, so I don't have teeth!
﻿But you know...
After you told me, an octopus,
that I was a cool guy...
After you said we could be friends...
I couldn't let you die!
I'm gonna save you!
Don't die on me!
Power x And x Games
While Killua was being rescued
by the Chimera Ant Ikalgo,
his supposed enemy,
Gon, too, was forming a bond with
a Chimera Ant called Meleoron.
You should stop smoking.
If the smoke sticks to you,
people can smell you coming, and it'll
waste your ability to become invisible.
I appreciate the warning.
But honestly, that doesn't matter.
While my invisibility is a sort of calling card,
my real power is on an entirely different level.
Just watch.
Huh?! He vanished in an instant...
I can't sense him at all.
Only the smell of cigarettes.
He's gone...
This isn't mere invisibility.
Does he also have the ability
to change locations instantly,
without making any sound?
That isn't possible!
How did he do it?!
Where'd you come from?
I've been here the entire time.
Huh?
My second ability is Perfect Plan.
God's Alibi
Perfect Plan
When I hold my breath,
no one can sense my existence.
You were even touching me...
But your mind didn't realize it.
Eh? I touched you?
You know how some people are easily overlooked?
When you go to a restaurant in a group,
there's always one person that the
waitress forgets to bring water.
This is an extreme version.
I'm right here, but no one notices me.
Oh...
I use my other ability to turn invisible
to cover this one so no one can learn about it.
For the record, you and I are
the only ones in the world
who know this.
Why tell me something so important?
Well, it's to build trust.
Since I'm the one who has to take a risk...
If I can't convince you to trust me,
we can't start anything.
You mean, what you said about
me being a valuable partner?
Yeah, but that's for later.
Like I said, we have to trust each other first.
Once you've agreed to be my
partner, I'll tell you more.
Okay, I'll be your partner.
That was fast!
You don't know how to bargain, kid.
Don't be so trusting of me!
Suspect everyone!
Until you've done due diligence,
don't trust anyone!
Huh?
I said it's okay, so why are
you being so difficult?
Can you even make this decision on your own?!
What about your buddy?
He'll have a fit
when he hears you teamed up with
a suspicious-looking monster...
And why am I insulting myself?
I didn't choose to be this way!
He talks a lot...
Whatever.
Even a friend of twenty years
could stab you in the back.
Time is no measure of trust!
Say, "Ho"!
You're no fun...
We can never be friends.
I feel the same way...
Then, are you sure about this?
About what?
About teaming up with me.
Won't your buddy object?
Most likely.
Because he tends to be cautious
and to question everything.
This won't work, then.
The deal's dead in the water.
But if I insist on having my way, it'll be fine.
Killua won't like it, but he'll give in.
Really... He must have a hard time.
Well, whatever.
If you say it's okay, I'll trust you.
So let's get to business.
Yeah.
I want to defeat the King.
Want to know why?
Yeah, of course.
That's what I've been waiting for...
Revenge.
Right now, I can't tell you
why I want revenge...
Okay.
I'd like to know, but I'll wait.
That's probably what he wants to hear...
If you're that curious, I'll tell you.
You'll tell me now?!
Just kidding!
Beg all you want, but I won't tell you now.
I didn't beg you for anything.
The King killed someone I owed my life to.
His name was Peggy.
I saw the King behead him right before my eyes.
But at the time, I didn't realize
what had happened.
Huh? Why not?
You saw it happen, didn't you?
Because I'd forgotten that Peggy
was the one who raised me.
A little while ago, I began to recover my
memories from when I was human.
I haven't remembered everything.
No, I should rephrase that...
I've only remembered a few things.
The names of my parents, my name,
episodes from my childhood.
Peggy was the name of the
Chimera Ant the King killed.
That was also my foster father's human name.
He was into education, and always
carried thick books around.
In both life and death, he never
parted with his books about NGL.
Then you all have memories
from when you were human?
I don't know if we're all the same.
Some Chimera Ants are clearly feral in nature.
With others, there's no
telling what they're thinking.
But I think I understand now.
This is why, when we first met,
I was willing to trust you.
You're very human.
More human than any other
Chimera Ant I've met.
In fact, I'd say you're still human.
Really? When I met you,
I had the opposite reaction.
Huh?
I could sense a vicious beast inside you.
That's why I wanted to team up.
There's no limit to what you'll do.
All right... Now, let's get down to business.
But first, could you tell me your name?
I'm Gon... Gon Freecss.
I actually have one more ability.
And the condition for its
activation has been met.
Time to show you my third power!
Activate!
It isn't flying away...
Does that mean I was using Perfect Plan, too?
Exactly.
This is my third power, God's Accomplice.
While Perfect Plan is active, it allows
anyone I touch to use it, as well.
Do you understand how powerful
this technique is now?
This power will let us approach
and attack the enemy...
without their knowledge.
The King's strength doesn't matter...
If we can sneak up and use a powerful
attack when his guard is lowered, we'll win.
Hey, Gon...
You're the partner I've been looking for.
The perfect guy to smack the King
with the strongest attack this world's ever seen!
I was watching
when you used that rock-paper-scissors thing.
Those were my soldiers.
I sent them to attack, so I could
measure your strength,
but they...
Ah, no need to feel bad...
They were killing for sport when
I wasn't paying attention.
They're no longer my soldiers, or even my allies.
Well, from their perspective,
I'm the one who's changed.
What you said about being your partner...
There's someone who'd be better than me.
You know someone?
Yep.
I'll contact him.
Hold on.
I trust you.
And even if you end up turning on me,
I won't blame you or regret my decision.
Because I watched you, spoke to you,
and decided to trust you.
But I'm not about to trust others
just because you trust them.
Do you understand?
I get your point, but...
My life is on the line here.
Listen to me.
Perfect Plan is not invincible.
In fact, it's highly vulnerable.
I can make people ignore my existence,
but I'm still right there in the same place.
They just don't notice me.
So their attacks can still hit me.
Knowing there's a person around with
my ability, what would someone do?
They'd launch attacks in every direction.
Oh, you're right...
If one of those attacks hits me,
even by dumb luck, I'm done for.
I hate to admit it,
but when it comes to combat,
I'm the weakest Chimera Ant around.
I'm on the same level as foot soldiers.
Forget the King...
I couldn't even survive a punch
from a Squadron Leader.
If I just turn invisible,
others can locate me with En.
It's been tested, so the other
Squadron Leaders know this, too.
I need my enemies to believe
my power to be weak.
They need to think En is enough to beat it.
This ability is only invincible
if no one knows about it.
Enough explaining...
My point is that I don't want to
reveal my power to any others!
Not even if it's someone you trust.
You can see for yourself, then.
I'll call him out here without mentioning you.
W-Wait...
You can watch from a distance.
Helloâ€”
Yo! I've been waiting, fool!
You pulled a fast one! Where are you?
I've got lots of questions for you.
Because of you kids, the boss
had to make a move...
The plan's been derailed,
but I support what you're doing.
Letting five million die isn't right.
The boss used his power to surround the capital.
Really?
That should make it harder for Neferpitou
to control puppets remotely.
In other words, they can't perform
the selection from a distance.
Right.
But the boss and Knov-san will be expending
all their energy to delay Neferpitou.
Which means, when the operation starts,
they won't be in any condition to
take on any of the Royal Guard.
We expect more citizens to gather
in the capital for the celebration.
There may be a massacre yet.
The situation's still grim...
We can no longer contact the Chairman.
He's holed up somewhere until the last
possible minute, preparing for the final battle.
We four need to make a decision.
Do we summon reinforcements, or do we
face the three Royal Guards by ourselves?
I'd like to know Killua's opinion.
He isn't here.
What? You split up?
I get it... He's been disrupting things alone.
Can you call him real quick?
No luck. He isn't picking up...
I think his is off.
Really? Well, keep trying.
We should meet up, the sooner the better.
Yeah.
Let's find a halfway point to meet.
Here... Mandai City.
Okay, got it.
Checkmate.
You're done.
Why didn't you resign?
Don't make me repeat myself.
The match ended twenty-two moves ago.
Why did you not resign then?
Did you believe I would make a mistake?
Idiot.
Next, we have the national Go champion.
Give me the rulebook.
It may look simple at first,
but it is a complex game.
It may take more time to learn than shogi.
Please let me leave!
What do you want?
Someone! Help me!
My glasses...
Silence.
You are in the King's presence.
The choice is yours.
Sit across from me now.
Or die.
5.5 points.
The King wins.
I-It only took him ten games?
I'm t-tired!
It's the only explanation for that loss!
And I think I have a fever.
I'm short on sleep.
And I feel dizzy...
I'll give you eight hours.
And any medicine you need.
I expect you to be in top condition.
Should you lose again, I won't
be interested in excuses.
Rest as if your life depends on it.
I'm impressed by how quickly
you learn these games.
I can't believe it took less than half
the time you spent mastering shogi.
It's all about learning the feel.
Chess, Go, shogi...
They have different rules, but all three
have a certain rhythm to their moves.
That means disrupting your
opponent's rhythm is crucial.
Once you've learned the openings,
you can deduce your opponent's rhythm.
Once you know their rhythm,
you need only disrupt it.
A psychological principle that
would apply to any contest.
If you've already reached that conclusion,
I don't see the benefit of playing more games.
I believe they will only bore you.
How many remain?
This country has one more professional game.
It's a board game called Gungi.
Gungi?
The game originated in East Gorteau,
and nearly all citizens know how to play.
Give me the rulebook.
As in chess and shogi, its goal is to trap the king.
But you can stack up to three pieces.
At the start, you may also freely place
your pieces within your own area.
The game has a different feel
due to the addition of a third dimension.
For the past fifteen years,
there have been world tournaments,
and East Gorteau has yet to lose.
Currently, they're on their third representative,
a five-time reigning champion.
Then, if I defeat this champion,
I'll be the best in the world?
A fitting way to end this recreation.
Bring them in.
There are six days until the selection.
The King has no idea
how this girl is about to influence his fate.
Next time: Check x And x Mate.
I'm Gon.
I'm Gillua.
Did you change your name?
No way.
Say it again.
I'm Gillua!
GG!
﻿Gungi?
For the past fifteen years,
there have been world tournaments,
and East Gorteau has yet to lose.
Currently, they're on their third representative,
a five-time reigning champion.
Then, if I defeat this champion,
I'll be the best in the world?
A fitting way to end this recreation.
Bring them in.
Check x And x Mate
Six days remain before
Neferpitou begins the selection.
The King has spent this time in his palace,
defeating the masters of shogi,
Go, and other board games.
The last remaining one,
the reigning Gungi world champion,
has just been summoned to his side.
U-Um...
Th-Thank you for infighting me—
For inciting me...
No need for small talk.
You and I will play Gungi.
Right now, I am learning the
rules, so you must wait.
Huh? You don't sound like the Supreme Leader.
He's dead.
Now I am the King.
I'm s-so sorry!
Please forgive me!
I'm only a fool, one who knows
nothing of the outside world!
I can't even talk normally...
You are distracting me. Be silent.
Or I'll kill you.
Okay, I basically understand.
Let us begin.
What's wrong?
It appears she's passed out.
After you told her to be quiet,
she shut her mouth...
Then, since her nose was stuffed up,
it seems she was unable to breathe.
This is an uncommonly stupid girl.
Yeah, that was embarrassing!
I can't even do things a baby can.
My parents are always yelling at me...
Just play the game.
Yes!
I'm honored to play against you.
You can see with your eyes?
No, I can't see a thing.
So would you please tell me your moves?
I only open them when I play.
If it bothers you, I can try to close them...
I don't care.
The atmosphere has changed.
4-4-1, pawn.
You can't reach him at all?
No, I guess his phone is off.
We agreed that he would initiate all contact,
so I guess I shouldn't be surprised.
Damn, then we have to wait for him to call?
Why does that guy look like he
was born in the wrong decade?
And the look on his face says
he's always looking for a fight...
The other has no eyebrows,
and that expression makes it
clear that he trusts no one.
It's not even a question of
whether he and I can get along.
I can already see he won't believe a word I say.
Gon, I'm sorry to say that my
first impression is very bad!
Unless I get some really good news soon,
there's no way I'll be able to trust them.
I guarantee it.
Hey, what's all this?
Beats me. Just a pack of strays, I guess.
They have collars...
He's been feeding all the animals
left behind due to the selection.
He's even sacrificed sleep...
I'm not feeding all of them!
I know we don't have time to waste on that!
So I abandoned those that stood no chance.
That's efficient, yeah?
Some were just skin and bones,
but still wouldn't take my food.
Some were so loyal, they wouldn't leave
their homes after I untied them...
What's so bad about saving
the ones that want the help?!
You don't have to cry about it.
I'm n-not crying, fool!
Want me to smack you?
That won't be enough to raise my opinion.
Well, he certainly is different, though.
7-8-2, spy.
Checkmate.
She's using an orthodox approach,
stacking archers on her pawns.
A standard strategy.
Textbook execution.
And her initial placement
is one used with beginners.
Meaning that I am not good enough
for her to show her true skill.
Another game.
Yes, absolutely!
8-8-1, knight.
I guess that's checkmate.
You're such a fast learner, Supreme Leader.
I'll have to step up my game,
or you'll get the jump on me!
That's enough... Go get some rest.
That isn't necessary... I'm just fine.
I can play Gungi for three days
and nights without sleep!
I have another guest.
Once I've finished with him, it'll be your turn.
Then I'll get a little rest.
What do you think?
It's but a matter of time.
There are more options to choose from,
but essentially, this game is
no different than the rest.
In four or five more games, she will
have to use her real ability.
Once that happens, I shall be
able to observe her rhythm.
Nothing has changed.
Your Majesty,
the Go player hanged himself.
Bring that idiot back.
While the King continues to play
against the Gungi master,
a short distance away, Morel has
been using his power to surround
the capital city of Peijing.
Purple Haze Soldiers
Deep Purple
Deep Purple.
First, he releases the aura that serves as a core.
He then envelops it in an aura haze,
creating a smoke puppet that he can
control at will via the Nen within the core.
His ability can sustain two hundred
and sixteen puppets at once.
On the chance that the enemy retaliates,
I've made my soldiers more responsive,
so I can only maintain fifty now.
But they're much stronger.
One advantage is that En can't differentiate
between one of these and a human.
But at heart, Chimera Ants are still ants.
So Neferpitou won't leave the King's side.
As expected, Neferpitou has recalled
the controlled humans to the capital
to take up defensive positions.
That implies the King's safety is top priority.
Which means that restricting the movement
of the Royal Guard is very easy.
However, the question is how the King will respond.
If we're dealing with a King who does as he
likes, it'll be harder to anticipate him.
And the risk of miscalculation increases.
But as long as they keep
these coming, we're fine.
Long time, no see.
I've been looking for you.
Bah, he's gotten stronger.
The air about him feels totally different.
Knuckle's APR is gone?
It doesn't appear to have become IRS, either.
If something had happened,
Knuckle's group would have contacted me.
If APR is gone,
they have someone who can dispel Nen.
Or did he do it himself?
Let's see what they can do.
Whichever wins...
In the end,
I will triumph.
Time to return the favor.
First, I'll beat you down.
Then it's the pompadour's turn.
His confidence is far from baseless.
He must have gained a new ability.
I wouldn't be so certain!
If that ability is to exorcise Nen,
we're in trouble.
Knuckle and Shoot both use
hit-and-fade fighting styles.
Shoot does what he can to support
Knuckle's Chapter 7 Bankruptcy.
But we can't nullify their Nen with ours
if they have someone who can dispel it.
A strategy that might have worked
against the King is useless now.
However...
if he has the ability to exorcise Nen,
this is a good opportunity.
If I neutralize him here, Knuckle
and Shoot can use their powers.
I must fight...
I can't drop Deep Purple, so I'll have
to get by on my remaining aura.
What?
He's still relying on speed?
There are plenty of ways to deal with
someone who only uses speed.
Now you're "It."
Huh? What was that?
Wh-Where am I?
A savannah?
Did he teleport me?
If this is his new ability,
a different Chimera Ant is the Nen exorcist.
That's bad.
Sure you should just be standing around?
It's time to start
this game of tag.
Tag?
We're in a field that I created.
Unless you touch me, you can't leave.
Your time limit is eight hours.
Let's start!
Hey!
Didn't you hear what I said?
You can't leave without touching me!
If I chase you, I'll never catch you.
So I'm going to take my time.
Morel disappeared with the enemy!
Cheetu has activated his power...
I don't know what it does, but they
won't be back for eight hours.
The scenery is just a wall.
Looks like I'm in some kind of space
separated from the real world, like he said.
Seems to be about the size of a baseball field.
If I stopped Deep Purple, I could
break out of here with ease.
However...
First, is it even possible for me to stop
Deep Purple from within this space?
Second, if I'm able to stop it,
will that aura return to me here, in this space?
The worst scenario would be one
in which I stop Deep Purple,
but the aura can't reach me in this space.
Once Deep Purple is halted,
it can't be reactivated until
I've recovered the aura.
It's too risky to try.
I can't stop Deep Purple.
At least, not yet.
Are you finally ready to start?
This way! Follow my lead!
Hold on, you aren't gonna...
You bet I am!
It's a waste of time.
You can't destroy the walls or the hourglass.
There's only one way out.
And that's to catch me.
I can tell that
Knuckle's Chapter 7 Bankruptcy
has weakened his power...
So then...
Hey, what happens if I don't touch
you within the time limit?
Who knows?
I have no obligation to answer that question.
Naturally, of course not.
It appears there's more to this ability.
I'm in for the long haul, then.
Wake me up in five hours.
Are you mocking me?
Go ahead, lose your temper.
It seems you don't understand your own power.
This isn't a battle of speed.
It's a battle of mental fortitude.
Deep Purple is still active...
So the operation continues.
Leol-sama, I've discovered another enemy.
It's a man in a suit, with black hair and glasses.
Anyone else around?
No, just the figures in white.
Those white figures are probably ordinary soldiers.
But it's possible that the true leader
is concealed among them.
And I can't let anyone see my power.
And Hirin is occupied with
exorcising the Nen on Cheetu...
Damn...
I need at least two more pawns!
Okay, but in return, you have to defeat him.
The King is nearly finished playing games.
After that, the King will insist on
defeating his enemies himself.
We will be there to guard him, but
you never know what might happen...
We would rather the King remain
inside until the selection is over.
Do you need something?
Give Leol a hand.
Yes, as you wish.
Well?
I am becoming worried.
They've played many times, but
the King is nowhere near victory.
This player is a true master...
I should have been able to break
her defenses from the left side.
But she used a peculiar move
sequence to turn the tables.
4-5-1, musketeer.
2-8-2, fortress.
What?
The spy has done nothing this entire match...
But suddenly, it controls the board!
My right side's been destroyed.
I'm done. That's checkmate.
Impossible.
From start to checkmate, there were
one hundred, forty-four moves.
This outcome could have only happened
if she foresaw each of my moves.
On to the next game.
Yes!
This is utterly impossible!
A storm is brewing.
The girl's strength upsets the King.
And a storm draws near the palace.
Next time: Doubt x And x Hesitation.
Please go easy on us.
Clack.
Whack.
Whoosh.
Clang.
Checkmate.
﻿How many are there?
Around five thousand.
And that's a fifth of what they were expecting.
The King must be angry about that.
No...
Apparently, he's been playing games in his room.
He's so obsessed with Gungi,
he's been skipping meals.
Then what about all this food?
Should we take it for ourselves?
You want to take on the King
and his Royal Guard?
Don't make me laugh.
Yeah...
Sometimes, you can't see how strong someone
is until you have enough strength yourself.
They're monsters. I'll do as they say.
When Shaia-dono gave us our powers,
he'd probably anticipated that
things would turn out this way.
Hagya's the only one who doesn't get it!
If you call him by his old name, he gets mad.
Doubt x And x Hesitation
The suit with the glasses is keeping
a careful watch on his surroundings
while heading toward the palace.
The puppets are useless against him.
He's strong.
What about his abilities?
Like the others, he has used
only physical attacks thus far.
Okay, let me know if he shows his power.
Once Welfin and Brovada arrive,
we'll take care of those figures in white.
I can also check out the
powers those two have.
Damn, I lost sight of him!
Leol-sama, it appears that the suit
with glasses is able to teleport.
Knov's ability is called Hide and Seek.
Four-Dimensional Apartment Complex
Hide and Seek
It allows him to teleport.
By placing a hand against a wall or the ground,
he can open a portal to access Nen space.
He is able to transport people
and objects through that portal.
Hide and Seek creates a Nen space of
twenty-one rooms, on four floors.
Each room is isolated.
The entrance shuts when anyone enters,
so to return to the real world,
one must exit by a different door.
It is possible to create multiple entrances.
The number of possible entrances differs
depending on the size of the room.
The exit leads back to the portal used for entry.
So, as a general rule, one can only enter
and exit via the location of the entry portal.
However, using Knov's master key,
an exit can be linked to any portal.
Nothing out of place.
Still quiet on the battlefront.
Morel's Deep Purple is used for
primarily defensive purposes.
If a puppet encounters someone who
isn't an ally, it will keep its distance.
If it comes under attack, it will
retreat, while fighting back.
The puppets fight back by throwing
nearby objects at the enemy.
They avoid direct contact,
so the enemy won't realize
they are Nen puppets.
That's a Chimera...
What is it doing?
We're pretty far from the battlefield.
Is it scouting the area?
There were strange dragonflies around town.
I thought they were a local species,
but might they be created from his Nen?
It's very likely...
If it's a Chimera Ant that specializes in
gathering intel, I must neutralize it quickly!
The battle is on.
Hey... Hey!
Aren't you gonna touch me?
Look how close I am...
I know you're awake.
Whoa, there!
I knew you were faking it.
You can't trick me!
With you being so noisy, I can't fall asleep!
Give me some peace and quiet!
No way!
I won't let you get any sleep!
I'll keep making noise until you chase me!
Idiot...
If that's what you wanted,
you should have set a rule
to force people to keep chasing you.
Looks like he's still getting
used to his new power...
Have it your way.
I won't be getting up for the next five hours.
He's really focused on making
this a contest of speed.
Coupled with his constant need for attention,
it's unlikely that he'll settle for
any other type of contest.
I'm not gonna let you sleep!
Hey! Over here!
I'm within reach...
Get up!
Look how close I am.
It's just a waiting game.
If he gives up and moves away...
I win.
9-9-1, marshal.
1-5-1, marshal.
7-9-1, pawn.
2-3-1, pawn.
8-1-1, spy.
2-3-1, cannon.
9-1-1, fortress.
2-7-2, musketeer.
The marshal has been isolated...
I'll call this "remote concealment."
7-1-2, fortress.
1-6-2, general.
9-1-3, archer.
3-2-2, major general.
I'm done.
Her initial placement was exactly as expected.
She's shifting toward my marshal
without breaking her crane formation.
Let us begin, then.
Her first move will be to position
her archer on her right flank.
She'll probably try a three-pronged
attack to end it quickly.
But shifting her pieces to the right
exposes her left flank to attack.
It's time to disrupt your rhythm.
1-9-3, new archer.
There it is.
9-7-1, new spy.
2-9-1, knight.
Her three-pronged attack
and left flank movement
will cost me two pieces.
But that created an opening in her left flank.
She'll probably expect me to
go all-in from that side.
But I won't!
Here it is!
5-5-1, lieutenant general.
Each of her moves has followed
a set rhythm until just now,
when she froze.
Given the current placement,
I can attack through the
center in unlimited ways.
There is no best move.
With every turn, I have the
ability to extend the match.
Now, let me hear you
squeal!
9-2-1, new lieutenant general.
That's checkmate.
You knew my strategy was a dead end.
Dead End
Yes.
Why did you need to think
before making your move?
You could have made that move at once.
The King has moved this match off the board.
A wrong answer could mean
her death.
Your "remote concealment" strategy
is actually named "kokoriko."
I came up with that strategy...
ten years ago.
Placing the lieutenant general in the center
to counter a three-pronged attack is also a
move I devised, called "general in the middle."
At the time, both drew a lot of attention.
Moving from kokoriko to general in the middle
was a popular transition that tested
both players' ability to read their opponents.
I was pretty happy
that a fool like me could figure
out a smart strategy...
But then, I saw how to defeat it.
A year after I came up with kokoriko,
an opponent used it against me
in the national tournament,
and I figured out how to counter it.
I won the match,
but the strategy disappeared from
official matches and textbooks.
That the Supreme Leader thought
of the same strategy as I had...
I was so honored, and touched...
My heart trembled.
It felt like...
Like seeing my child brought back to life.
That was how it felt.
So it was difficult for me
to take that life again.
That was why
I hesitated.
Foolishness.
I've had enough.
Get some rest.
Once we begin again,
you won't get any more breaks.
Be prepared!
Y-Yes...
I believe this is
the first time the King has ever listened
to anyone speak for such a long time.
Well,
it should have no significance...
Four hours have passed?
He got bored and started reading...
That guy's too easy to understand.
Oh, you're ready to start?
Has it already been five hours?
Wait, it's only half full.
Are you getting worried?
You just noticed?
We aren't starting now.
It's already over.
Look at your ankle.
A rope of smoke?
That took a lot of effort...
I had to go all the way around
so you wouldn't notice,
so it turned into quite a long rope.
In any case, all that's left
is to wind up the rope.
Now it's only a matter of time.
Your turn to try whatever you can.
But it won't work.
You should take the smoke seriously.
Essentially, it's a rope that can't be severed.
You can struggle all you want.
I knew it...
He won't attack me because
this is a game of tag.
If I touch his body, it will break his ability.
He has no patience, but he chose
for the game to last eight hours.
I'm not the one you're putting pressure on.
The pressure's on you.
Cheetu's power was still a work in progress.
With his back against the wall,
desperate for a way out...
He created a new ability.
A crossbow and claws.
He can fight at any range.
Thanks!
You helped me gain an awesome new power!
Hey, do you know what this is?
It's a bow. A bow!
You sure you want to come closer?!
There!
I'm quite sure.
Why would you want a power
that's slower than you are?
Ah.
Why don't you try those claws?
Then I won't have to walk over.
I'll tell you why you lost.
It's because
you're an idiot.
Die!
Then you can never touch me!
This sensation...
It can't be...
Smoke?
No way!
Caught you.
Wh-When did you...
While you were reading manga
and laughing like a fool,
I created a copy of myself from smoke.
And I covered myself with smoke
that looked like grass.
My copy went one way, and I went the other.
The fight continues, even while one sleeps.
You shouldn't have looked away.
Looks like we're back...
Well, do you still want to fight?
No, I've had enough.
That's a wise decision...
Then why not tell me
what would have happened
if I hadn't caught you?
There's no point in asking.
Once I've been caught,
I can't use that power anymore.
That was the condition I set.
Really? I feel bad...
It's no big deal.
I'll ask Shaia-sama for a new power!
Next time, I won't lose.
You'd better be ready!
His superior
is most likely a Royal Guard named Shaia,
who has the power to release Nen skills.
So if the selection is carried out,
winning will become very difficult.
Gon and Killua made the right choice.
We need to meet.
Let's talk inside.
Reinforcements have arrived.
It's a crayfish and a wolf.
Are they strong?
If I knew, my job would be easier...
Right now, they're trying to gauge our strength.
So it's currently a stalemate.
Our goal is to buy time, so it all works out.
I suspect it's because I took out this one.
Those dragonflies were acting
as security cameras.
Come in, Flutter!
Doesn't seem he's going to show.
Change in plans!
Without Flutter, we have no way
to know the enemy's location.
Damn.
When it really counts, he lets me down!
Should I call it off?
No, I can't do that.
I cannot lose face in front of Pitou again!
We're heading back, then.
Ah, hold on...
It's okay. I'll find a way to handle it.
Rental Pod
IOU Dispenser
Is that your power?
Yeah, I can use it to scout around.
Don't tell anyone else...
I'm showing you because I trust you.
Idiots, I wouldn't tell you the truth.
Leol's Rental Pod allows him to temporarily
borrow an ability in exchange
for granting the target a favor.
However, two conditions must be met.
First,
he must have seen the ability or know its name.
Satellite Dragonflies
Second, he must grant a favor.
After confirming that his favor is not
free and is expected to be repaid,
this skill will activate, assuming
the target agrees to his conditions.
Got it!
Once all conditions are met, Leol's
dispenser automatically stores data,
which can be checked at any time.
However, if the target dies,
the data will be deleted.
Flutter's fine.
I believe there's been no communication
because he's unconscious or far away.
A rental can be used for one hour.
During the rental period, the target
cannot use the borrowed power.
Anyway, Flutter is still alive...
Looks like we'll be able to stay in touch.
Once Flutter's Satellite Dragonflies
verify the location of the suit
with the glasses, we'll start.
So we keep the small fry at a distance
while you take on the suit with the glasses.
You gonna be okay on your own?
Just trust me. I wouldn't give
you a job you can't handle.
And I don't want you to see my power.
I'll do whatever it takes to
complete this mission.
Okay...
I can't afford to wait around here.
Not until the King is in my debt!
When Leol takes the dispensed IOU and
tears it up, the effect activates.
They're here.
Time to start scouting.
I don't understand.
This is upsetting.
During our matches, I am the only
one who's getting flustered.
I would have expected this to be
humiliating on a new level.
But...
At the same time, I am enjoying our matches.
But I don't understand why...
Next time: Resolve x And x Awakening.
Morel-san, what's in your pipe?
It holds...
Gulp.
...tonkotsu.
﻿Your "remote concealment" strategy
is actually named "kokoriko."
I came up with that strategy...
ten years ago.
I was pretty happy
that a fool like me could figure
out a smart strategy...
But then, I saw how to defeat it.
That the Supreme Leader thought
of the same strategy as I had...
I was so honored and touched...
My heart trembled.
It felt like...
Like seeing my child brought back to life.
Foolishness.
I've had enough.
Get some rest.
Once we begin again,
you won't get any more breaks.
Be prepared!
Resolve x And x Awakening
This is upsetting.
During our matches, I am the only
one who's getting flustered.
I would have expected this to be
humiliating on a new level.
But...
At the same time, I am enjoying our matches.
But I don't understand why...
That I do not understand my own mind
upsets me more than words can describe!
Did she not choose to rest?
No...
Unsightly.
No sign of intelligence or dignity.
How can such a being
boast a Gungi record so stellar
that it could be called
the ultimate in game theory?
Wake up! We're starting again.
Y-Yes...
9-5-1, marshal.
For this match...
Hmm?
We should make a wager.
A wager?
Correct.
If you win, I shall grant
any wish you request.
Any wish I request?
Any wish...
However...
If you lose,
I shall take your left arm.
Fear and desire hold the power
to disrupt one's rhythm.
Desire clouds vision,
while fear stills one's step.
My left arm...
My left arm...
Should I do it?!
Why do you hesitate?
Well... Instead of my left arm...
Is it all right if I bet the thing I usually bet?
What?
What do you bet?
My life.
If I lose, I will offer you my life.
But you might consider that an insult...
I do not understand.
Explain yourself.
Um...
Well, Gungi is really the only thing I can do.
In other words, Gungi is the reason I'm alive.
But professional Gungi players,
even national champions, make but a pittance.
Only after you become the world
champion as representative for a nation
will you receive any meaningful reward.
To become the national representative,
you must win tournaments.
In other words, you cannot lose a single match.
I come from a family of twelve,
and in our home, I'm the breadwinner.
If I lose a single match,
I will become the greatest burden on my family.
Gungi players have a saying...
That, after losing once, a Gungi master
becomes a normal person.
If I lose,
I'll be garbage.
Ah, it doesn't bother me!
It's just what my parents always said...
So, the day I set my sights on
becoming a professional player,
I decided that if I ever lost a match,
I would take my own life.
But that could be a problem...
How so?
When I lose, I'll become garbage...
And all you'd receive for
winning would be garbage.
That would be a terrible insult.
It doesn't bother me.
I'm more interested in learning
what you'd want if you win.
You see...
I've spent all of my time thinking about Gungi...
I'll think about it later, after I win.
Very well.
Then she possesses neither desire nor fear?
Your life, was it?
It appears I was the one lacking in resolve!
I never imagined that, if you won,
you might ask for my life.
Your Majesty!
Silence!
The Supreme Leader's l-li—
I w-would never ask such a thing!
The thought never crossed my mind!
I know that.
The fault is my own.
The wager is off.
It was a petty tactic.
No...
Accept this apology.
Your Majesty!
How could you do that?
I must treat your arm...
Come with me!
Y-Your arm?
Continue the match.
Huh? Huh?
What happened, Supreme Leader?
It's your turn. Make your move.
Your Majesty... We must stop the bleeding!
Do not make me repeat myself.
Continue the match.
It was I who said there would be no more breaks.
Or do you insist that I embarrass myself again?
I shall summon Neferpitou.
I am sure that you can continue to play,
as your arm is reattached.
That is the best compromise I can offer.
If you refuse to accept it,
you may take my head now!
Very well.
Come closer.
I shall end it with a single strike.
It's your turn.
Make your move.
I refuse.
I refuse to move before you
have your injury treated.
Don't make me repeat myself.
Make your move.
I refuse.
If you wish to kill me,
use Gungi!
Why, you...
Summon Pitou!
At once!
There's no doubt.
All the puppets have vanished.
Have they resumed the selection process?
No, I doubt it.
We have the capital surrounded.
The King's safety is their top priority.
They wouldn't leave him.
Then what's going on?
My assumption would be that
some threat greater than us
has befallen the Royal Guard,
or upon the King himself.
So this is it?
Our golden opportunity?
Yes...
Our chance to infiltrate the palace.
However, it may be a trap.
That shouldn't be the case...
They wouldn't use any tactic that
might endanger the King.
They would if the King ordered it.
I suppose...
Regardless, they've retracted
their long-range radar.
We should use this chance to
get as close as possible.
I must create a portal near the palace,
or the plan will fail.
This dangerous job had to be done eventually.
And the time is now.
There!
I found them.
It appears Cheetu failed.
Try not to die.
Same to you.
They've split up for us.
I found them.
We'll switch to the man with the pipe!
Let's go!
Doctor Blythe.
Toy Repair
Doctor Blythe
7-9-1, spy.
2-3-1, pawn.
How long will the operation take?
I'd say two or three hours
until complete recovery.
And during that time, you cannot use
either your puppets or En, correct?
This ability requires a lot of Nen.
A great deal of energy is needed to recreate flesh.
While you treat His Majesty,
I shall watch the surroundings.
Though my En is nowhere as effective as yours.
Regardless, this is an important task
that I cannot trust to anyone else.
As expected, I cannot sense any En use...
The rain helps to lower visibility.
Soon, the sun will set.
Once it is night, I can hide in the darkness.
And picking out enemy aura will be easier.
Be patient.
The closer the portal is to
the palace, the better.
But if I'm spotted, it will all be useless.
While I can enter and exit freely,
Shoot and the rest can only use
the portal to leave once they enter.
If the enemy prepares an ambush by the exit,
it will mean serious trouble.
I must prepare three exits in the area
around the palace, one near, one far,
and one somewhere in between, then
place entrances even further away.
I'll set up the entrances in groups of three,
in locations where the palace is within sight.
When the mission starts, we can enter
by the most convenient location.
Once it's time to act,
the situation will determine
whether we approach
by the near exit, the far exit,
or the one in between.
Once that has been determined, we act.
From the enemy's perspective,
we will be appearing from nowhere.
We must use that opening to separate
the King and Royal Guard.
That is when our battles will begin!
It doesn't matter if we finish with a 1-3 record,
so long as the King is their one loss.
Under normal circumstances,
I would already be within
range of Neferpitou's En.
This is quite tense...
However, I am still far away.
The farthest exit
must be on the palace grounds,
or it won't be any use to us!
Advance carefully, but swiftly!
Should I wait for the sun to set?
But, will this scenario hold out until then?
I have no choice...
Should Neferpitou's En return,
approaching the palace will be impossible.
If I fail, we still have other options!
I have nothing to fear.
Advance...
Advance...
In the palace,
there are three humans not intended as food.
The first is the Gungi player.
The second is Diego.
And the third...
is Secretary Bizeff.
Behind the scenes, he was
the country's true ruler.
All dealings with foreign parties
and domestic organizations
went through him as an intermediary.
Since he cannot be replaced,
he is the only human allowed near the King.
No human guards are posted near the palace.
Because ordinary soldiers would
be powerless against Nen users,
the Royal Guard determined that the
presence of ordinary soldiers would,
in fact, increase the risk of infiltration.
The only Squadron Leader present
is Cheetu, who has just returned.
There are only six other Captain and Soldier Ants.
In other words,
there are currently only three humans
and eleven Ants in the palace.
The Soldier Ants are
the various Squadron Leaders' personal troops.
Thus, they are not involved
in the King's protection.
Essentially, the Squadron Leaders
no longer have any strict fealty to the King.
They work together simply
because their goals align.
Understanding this, Pitou and the Royal Guard
have assigned those Chimera Ants tasks
that are expected to end in failure.
Hence, they would not be trusted
with monitoring the palace.
However, Knov does not know this.
As he attempts to infiltrate the palace,
he has no idea that this is
his best, and last, chance.
I managed to survive somehow...
But on my own, I can only work so much.
I must convince them
to at least provide three more
staffers to do secretarial duties...
Otherwise, I'll die of overwork.
Sending list of available bodies.
"Thinker...
Bell."
Per our arrangement,
I request numbers 2, 16, 79, 103, and 119.
This is it.
He took the bait, Palm-kun!
While Knov works to infiltrate the palace,
Palm is preparing to launch
her own infiltration plan.
Next time: Knov x And x Morel.
Today, this person is joining me!
Why am I here?
Because Killua isn't around!
Scream.
﻿If you lose,
I shall take your left arm.
Well... Instead of my left arm...
Is it all right if I bet the thing I usually bet?
What?
What do you bet?
My life.
Your life, was it?
It appears I was the one lacking in resolve!
Accept this apology.
So this is it?
Our golden opportunity?
Yes...
Our chance to infiltrate the palace.
Knov x And x Morel
Neferpitou has stopped
using En, in order to heal the King's injury.
Knov takes this opportunity
to infiltrate the palace.
Finally, I've gotten this close.
Still more than one hundred meters
to the central stairway.
These strange trees bear very large fruit.
Around five hundred per tree...
And there are ten trees.
A total of five thousand.
Five hundred thousand people were to undergo
the selection process each day,
with a one-percent survival rate.
But thanks to Killua's distractions,
that schedule was only fulfilled on one day,
so the numbers add up...
These are cocoons holding the
humans who were selected.
Which means they will become Nen-wielding
human weapons at the King's disposal,
turning against the rest of humanity.
Neferpitou is probably a Manipulator...
and intends to manipulate these
soldiers per the King's will,
expanding his conquest throughout the world.
I will not let that happen!
First, the far exit... is set.
Next...
I must get closer.
The palace entrance looks dark...
So far, so good...
Middle exit... set.
Now for the near exit.
There aren't any guards...
I'd imagine only a select few are inside.
This will work.
If I've come this far,
I can reach the inner palace.
The throne room is on the third
floor, at the rear and center.
King
We must delay any reinforcements,
even if by only a second.
Central Stairway
The first floor is too far for that.
The central stairway, second floor.
That's the best location!
The central stairway is beyond this courtyard...
To be safe, I'll leave an exit here...
No, that would be no different
from the one outside...
It should at least
be next to the first floor's central stairway.
Then, if I can, I'll go up from
there to the second floor...
Window Opener
Scream
Scream...
Close!
Are any others around?
If I'm seen, it's over.
I'll have to retreat...
Nothing's coming?
Then it was alone?
This is it.
I can't move beyond this point...
If I do, I'll be killed.
What is that aura?
It appears to be full of all
kinds of misfortune...
At this point, I don't fear death.
What I fear is that,
before killing me,
the monsters up there
will squeeze every drop of information
from me that I have on the King...
Using any brutal means necessary.
If I'm caught, I won't be able to resist...
The aura's strength
just confirms it...
This is as far as I go...
Oh, aren't you that lion guy from TV?
My name is Leol, and don't forget it.
I heard that I should expect
a crayfish and wolf.
They're dealing with the grunts you created.
So I can fight you one-on-one.
I appreciate that.
This guy's just as strong as Cheetu.
No, he's a little stronger.
Let's get started.
Right now, allowing Knov to get
into the palace is the priority.
Until that happens, I need to
divert the enemy's attention.
That won't help.
This is Marcos.
Do you have the meat?
Yes, as requested.
Refrigerated trucks are entering
the underground warehouse...
They're shipping in food.
If the information Marcos
provided was accurate,
living women are also inside.
Not for the King, but for the
lecherous Secretary Bizeff.
If everything is going as planned,
Palm should be inside.
Leave the fourth truck as it is.
Yes, sir.
Then we'll be leaving.
Area D, of the underground warehouse.
My very own paradise, where no one can interfere.
Now, please step out.
There's nothing to worry about.
From now on, you will work here.
I've prepared rooms for each of you.
You will be provided with all necessities.
In your spare time, you may do as you want.
As long as you don't attempt to escape.
Your only job
is to follow my orders.
When summoned, you must drop everything,
and come to see me at once.
Yes, Mr. Secretary.
Excellent.
You...
Come with me.
Yes.
The rest of you can wait in your rooms.
Yes...
The Secretary was...
...interested in us!
I must find a way out of here,
so I can see the King and his Royal Guard.
Using her crystal ball, Palm can observe
the current whereabouts of
anyone she has seen previously.
This power will allow her to keep tabs
on the King and Royal Guard.
The Hunters will then be able to determine
the optimal route for the operation.
Only one exit.
I'll have to manipulate Bizeff.
My mission is crucial for
increasing our chances
of defeating the King!
What matters most isn't that I succeed...
But that, should I fail and be captured,
I kill myself immediately.
I should be safe here...
Palm...
Don't do anything foolish!
I managed to place the exits,
so even if your mission doesn't succeed,
we can still execute the operation.
If you get caught, it's over...
That...
That...
That vicious aura...
One look
was all it took
to break my will...
Gon... Killua...
You must have seen that aura...
You were probably even closer,
actually touching it...
Yet...
How are you still able
to face them?
How can you bring yourself to fight?
Is it to save your friends?
To protect humanity?
Why...
Why are you still fighting?
Palm!
Please...
Don't do anything foolish.
I beg you...
If you're caught, it's all over...
Palm!
I won't be able...
to go back there...
I brought you something cold to drink.
You're dismissed.
Wait in your room.
Yes.
Your lack of familiarity with the
area has sealed your defeat.
Though it's almost too perfect that,
after all that running,
you ended up in an underground church.
In case of emergency, this place
is used as an air shelter.
An ideal place to die in a vain struggle.
Well, you'll have to say your own prayers.
I'm an atheist.
You're a cocky guy.
Let's see who's trapped whom.
Cheetu told me everything.
I hear you can mold that
smoke into various objects.
Knowing that, he still chased me in here?
Even better.
If he believes things are going his way,
he won't hesitate to display his abilities.
However,
I've yet to meet anyone whose power
allows them to react more
flexibly than Deep Purple.
I can feel the tension in the air... I love it.
Both of us waiting to reveal our abilities...
I really dig it.
It's common sense to defeat an opponent
before they can use their power.
But that isn't how men
should fight.
Hey, what are you up to?
Voluntarily removing one of your senses?
Have you heard of the band Black Planet?
Their second album is super cool.
It's a twelve-song medley.
Listening to the whole thing's
like reading a good book.
When you finish it, you feel great.
I know.
And best part of all, the medley's
exactly sixty minutes long.
It's a masterpiece!
I hate to admit it, but I agree.
Rental, start!
This could be bad...
I have a hard time fighting
others who share my tastes.
Next time: Return x And x Retire.
Killua!
Return on.
Killua!
To the next episode preview!
It has to be you, Killua!
Hey, stop crying.
﻿Leol has chased Morel into
an underground church,
where they will now fight one another.
This ability only activates when it rains.
Inamura!
Return x And x Retire
My Inamura
summons waves!
Well? Aren't my big waves rad?
I can easily wash away your wimpy smoke!
You're having trouble moving
in the water, right?
You like how easily my board can maneuver?
If you stand still, I'll give you a quick death.
That's not your ability.
It belongs
to my buddy!
Oh, making a boat of smoke?
So he can stand on that smoke?
You think that's enough to defeat my waves?
I told you, that's not your ability!
This one is my own original...
Tornave!
Maelstrom!!
Tornave
The current's so strong...
I can't tell up from down.
This is bad.
I can't control my body at all...
I stop my opponent's
movements with a whirlpool.
Here I go!
Then, I finish him with a harpoon from above!
My harpoon can match the speed of sound,
and pierce a whale at the very bottom
of the ocean, even from the sky!
Take this!
He disappeared?
Impossible!
The whirlpool should have incapacitated him.
He had no way to escape.
Bastard...
How did you do it?
I simply exhaled.
When it comes to lung capacity,
no one in the world beats me.
He used his breath as jet propulsion
to break out of the whirlpool?
Okay, it's my turn now!
It's your turn?
In this battle, you don't get a turn!
All you get to do is drown in my waves!
During this exchange, I've learned three things.
First, I now know your power.
Somehow, you're able to use
other people's abilities.
And those earphones
have nothing to do with your power.
They're either for show or for luck.
Or it means someone is sending you orders.
If he meant to impair his hearing
to strengthen his power,
he shouldn't be able to hear me talk.
What's the third thing?
Your lifespan.
That Inamura ability belongs
to a Hunter named Grachan.
You probably encountered and defeated
him when he was sent
to fight the Chimera Ants.
I'll punish you for stealing my buddy's ability!
Your life ends today!
Hold on...
That's a totally one-sided misinterpretation.
I was protecting myself from humans
who were hunting me down.
It was self-defense.
And I didn't steal his ability.
I'm just borrowing it for a bit.
Just borrowing it for a bit?
That's an excuse thieves use.
Well, arguing with you is pointless.
I'd like to get my hands on his ability,
but defeating him is more important.
Right now, our top priority
is to defeat one another.
I'll repeat myself...
I'm sorry, but you don't get a turn!
Big Wall!
Giant Wave
Big Wall
I'm flooding this underground church.
My wall of water's gonna suck you in!
Just try and find your way to the surface!
Now, will he make it up?
Will I smash his skull with my board?
Launch my harpoon through his gut?
Which do I choose?
Either way,
if he shows his face above water, he's done.
He isn't coming back up...
Has he drowned?
No,
he was confident about his lung capacity.
That means he can survive for
ten or twenty minutes.
No, wait.
It's just possible
that he's able to remain underwater like a whale!
There you are!
Don't move!
I'll impale you with my harpoon.
Bubbles on the opposite side, too?
And over here!
And over there!
There are air bubbles everywhere...
I see...
It's possible, if he formed his smoke
into a hose with multiple branches.
That way, he wouldn't give away his position.
Hey! How long are you gonna stay under?
Do you expect me to give up and drain the water?
No, that isn't it!
The bubbles are camouflage!
Is he running?
If his lung capacity is that great, it's possible
he could swim out through the maze of
underground corridors leading down here.
I can't let him escape!
I told Welfin and Brovada to stay out of this,
so I could take all the credit...
My head's spinning?
And my chest hurts...
Have I been poisoned?
My board disappeared?
Is it because my physical and
mental stability are compromised?
Can't move...
Can't breathe...
My power stopped working,
but the water hasn't gone away?
Because we're underground?
Crap...
I let him think he had the advantage
so I could turn the tables on him.
But it looks as though the one
who was backed into a corner...
was me...
Am I gonna die?
Am I... Am I gonna die here?
So he was using smoke hoses
to send air bubbles everywhere.
But what kind of...
poison did he use?
That was faster than I expected.
The poison you've inhaled is lethal.
But it's something naturally found in air.
Carbon dioxide.
Carbon Dioxide
Morel used his immense lung capacity
to suck in the stagnant air trapped in the church,
and exhaled it with an increased
concentration of carbon dioxide.
I started my attack
before you ever began.
If he was telling the truth,
Grachan should be getting his ability back.
I have a few hours in which to move around.
During that time, I must see
them with my own eyes!
I've observed Bizeff's movements
with my crystal ball.
I know how to leave this area.
Even if Bizeff learns I've escaped,
he can't tell anyone because
he's kept this area a secret.
They are...
up above.
I can't go any farther.
But...
Oh? How are you feeling?
Octopus! Where am I?
How long was I out?
Don't call me an octopus!
This is an underground clinic for folks
with roots in the underworld.
You were out for two whole days.
Two days?! I need to get going!
Hey!
You shouldn't move around!
Your wounds will reopen.
I have to follow through with the plan...
Fool!
You were just on the verge of death!
You need a few days beforeâ€”
Oh, you're awake?
That's great.
Thanks for everything you've done.
I'm checking out now.
Not until you pay me.
Your total bill comes to 1.8 million Jenny.
If you can't pay, I'll take body parts instead.
I don't have my wallet on me.
I'll wire it to you when I get back.
I'm not stupid enough to trust
that you'll keep that promise.
Until you find someone to bring
the money, you're staying here.
I don't have time for that!
Give me a phone!
It costs 10,000 Jenny per minute.
Would you just shut up and go away?
Hello?
Hey, it's me.
Killua!
Where are you? Are you okay?
What happened?
I'll explain when I see you.
A strong enemy gave me some trouble.
I've been in the hospital.
Oh...
Well, I'm glad you called.
This means you're okay now, right?
Yeah, I'll be back soon.
Anything happen on your side?
We've found a strong ally.
He's bonding with Knuckle.
We have a plan that could
defeat the King if it goes well.
Oh...
We should meet, so I can hear what you think.
Okay.
Then, I need you to send money
to a certain bank account.
If you do that, we can rendezvous today.
That just leaves Palm.
You haven't been able to reach her?
No.
She's probably still in the palace...
But wouldn't that mean Neferpitou's
Nen has already exposed her?
I imagine she's in the warehouse,
beneath the palace.
There are about five kilometers
of corridors surrounding it.
Pitou's En can't reach that far.
But since the exit is in the
palace, she can't get out.
How's Knov-san doing?
Well...
he's probably out of this fight.
But he did manage to place the exits.
There's no change to our plan.
Three days to go...
His wounds are already healed!
No problem.
Okay, I confirmed receipt of the money.
You can leave. Right now.
What are you doing?
Let's go.
Huh?
We're gonna join my buddies.
I'll introduce you.
But...
Well, I won't force you.
I'll just tell you this.
Thank you.
Uh, wait...
Actually...
It's okay if I come?
I mean, I'm just a...
What?
Was I the only one who thought
we were already friends?
It's really...
okay?
It isn't about what's okay.
It's whether you're coming or not.
I'm going! I'm going with you!
I want to make something clear.
The next time something like this happens,
I won't bother thanking you.
So if something happens,
and I end up helping you,
you don't need to thank me.
Friends are supposed to help friends.
From now on, we'll be working together.
So we'll be helping each other.
Supporting each other isn't a big deal.
It'd be lame to thank each other
for every little thing.
Yeah, this is it.
This is the world I wanted.
The world I longed for and sought...
But deep down, I thought
it was beyond my reach...
That it wasn't meant for me...
And wouldn't happen...
I'd given up on this world.
I thought it wasn't meant to be...
Killua, I'm...
I'm so happy, I could die!
Huh? Why are you crying?
Because...
Because you're doing this for me!
Come on...
I want to make one more thing clear.
The world you're stepping into is far more brutal
than the world of the Chimera Ants.
They may seem similar,
but there's a huge difference between
risking a life and throwing it away.
People staring death in the face every day
don't want to hear that someone's ready to die.
Only people who maintain a daily
regimen to stay in tip-top shape,
and can swallow just enough poison to
fall short of a lethal dose, get to survive.
That's how it goes.
Are you ready to join us?
How could you know
the words I most wanted to hear?
A foolish question.
I see paradise before me.
I'm going, no matter what it costs me.
I've seen the other side...
I've made contact.
I've learned it really exists...
And I can reach it!
Next time: Gungi x Of x Komugi.
2-1-3, marshal.
4-5-1, knight.
8-7-uh...
lieutenant general!
4-3-3... 2?
My phone number!
﻿Three days remain until the selection begins.
In the palace, the King has
completed his recovery,
and continues to play Gungi without rest.
That's checkmate.
Her mind and body are at their limit.
I estimate it will only take another
match or two before the King wins.
Gungi x Of x Komugi
Time for a break.
We will resume in a half day.
Wait, I can keep going!
If you can barely sit straight,
the victory won't satisfy me.
Recover your strength.
Even while his arm was being treated,
the King never stopped playing.
But now he changes his mind?
This female is dangerous.
If this continues,
she could prove quite troublesome...
Then, I will excuse myself.
I must not be too hasty.
The King chose to retract his decree.
In order to stay true to his convictions...
In order to defeat the Gungi
Champion at her best...
In order to demonstrate his strength!
If I kill this girl now,
the King will remain a loser at Gungi forever.
Her death will cement her status
as someone the King could never defeat!
I am such a fool!
My hasty impulse could have left
the King with a permanent scar!
I shall die of my own volition!
Once I have seen the King conquer the world...
Using Knov-san's Apartment Complex,
seven people will infiltrate the palace.
Shoot and me...
Gon, Killua,
Meleoron, Ikalgo,
and then Morel.
A few seconds after us,
the Chairman will enter from beyond Pitou's En.
During that time, we must draw
the Royal Guard from the King.
Gon, Killua, and Ikalgo will go in first.
When we suddenly appear
in the midst of the palace,
their immediate reaction will be...
To protect the King with their lives.
They'll probably use a formation like this.
Breaking it won't be easy.
And that's where I come in.
Okay, any questions?
Uh, about Palm...
Can we do anything to learn
what's happened to her?
She's either dead or in hiding.
If she'd gotten out, she'd have contacted us.
Since she hasn't, that's the only explanation.
If she were captured,
she'd have taken her own life.
When she left, she was prepared for that.
If we try to check in on her,
it would be an insult to her resolve.
Hey, you're being too harsh!
Gon's just concerned about Palm.
And his concern is worthless.
What's that?!
You just came back! Where do you get off?!
Assuming that Palm was captured alive,
it would mean the enemy knows our plan.
Which would make us like moths
flying straight into the flame.
We'll be destroyed instantly.
But instead of worrying about worst-case scenarios,
what's important is that we trust Palm.
Well, that certainly makes sense,
but Gon's point might be that,
if Palm has met such a fate, we still
have time to change the plan.
Think again.
He'll say that we have to save Palm first.
But he won't offer any plans for that.
Right?
R-Right...
I see your point...
I know you're worried,
but once the operation starts,
you'll have to forget her until we're done.
If you're distracted for a fraction of a second,
that might cause our operation to fail.
We still have two days...
There's still time for Palm to contact us.
Nyow I understand.
Should I have tried to escape to the right?
You should have moved your knight.
I didn't want to let a single piece
control the center of the board.
Sometimes, you must accept
the risk and move forward.
Otherwise, you won't ever be
able to make me hesitate.
I am unaccustomed to playing a waiting game.
Your Majesty...
What is it?
I have some sensitive information,
so we should step outside.
It's fine, speak.
Two days remain until the National Celebration.
The number of citizens to process in Peijing
has increased beyond our expectations.
But the weather forecast is favorable,
so the selection should proceed as planned.
Get to the point.
I would like to move up
the post-selection schedule.
That's it? Do as you wish.
Yes, sir.
In that case, we will depart
immediately after the selection—
Don't make me repeat myself!
I'm telling you to decide on your own.
Do not return until I summon you.
So you were chased out, too?
Well, we only need to wait for the King to win.
You think that will only be a
few more matches, right?
No.
Wasn't that what you said a while ago?
The King is improving at a remarkable rate.
However, she is also evolving.
I am no longer able to predict the outcome.
Well, it's still only a matter of
time before the King wins.
I hope you're right.
I am. There's nothing to worry about.
I am one hundred percent confident
that he's acting on his own...
The man who defeated Leol.
The reports from Welfin and Brovada confirm it.
The soldiers under his control
are all smoke puppets.
Since their complex movements
are not typical of Nen puppets,
they fooled me as effectively as a smokescreen.
He can't control as many puppets as I can,
but his are more responsive.
I want to fight him...
But I can't leave my post.
Maybe he'll come to me...
It's about time for us to enter Peijing.
The enemy should have noticed
Morel's distraction by now.
We'll make some noise in Peijing to negate
their belief that this is all the work of one man.
At the same time,
many citizens will be moving toward the palace.
If we disappear the day before the celebration,
they'll believe assassins are hidden
among the citizens, trying to kill the King.
And their focus will be outside
the palace, on the crowds.
That's when we enter the palace with
Four-Dimensional Apartment Complex!
The King will definitely be here.
Watching the selection from
the third-floor throne room.
Will he really be there?
Something...
feels off.
2-1-3, pawn.
4-5-1, knight.
8-7-2, lieutenant general.
4-3-3, archer.
She continues to attack where
I'm weak without hesitation.
As we play, she's getting sharper.
2-1-1, knight.
6-6-1, major general.
But it does not pain me.
Rather, I find this enjoyable.
Because the board dictates my every move.
Which proves that she is still
several levels above me.
How strong can she become?
Supreme Leader...
I feel...
strange.
I can't stop.
Marvelous moves keep flooding into my mind...
I can become even better!
Has she awakened?
Then she's only
begun to grow.
That's checkmate.
Could I take a short break?
It's the first time she's asked for a break...
Is something wrong?
No, I'd like to return to my room to
record the moves that are in my mind.
But you can't see...
Oh, I'll just move the pieces around the board!
When I touch the pieces after they're placed,
I will never forget their position.
She's memorized every placement
she's ever experienced?
Very well, you're excused.
Thank you.
A foolish question...
Her name...
Hey.
What is your name?
You mean mine?
Is there anyone else around?
It's K-K-Komugi.
Komugi?
Supreme Leader...
Can you please tell me
what your name is?
My name?
What...
am I called?
Pitou.
Yes, what do you need?
Pouf.
Yes.
Youpi.
Yes.
Is something the matter?
Pouf...
Yes?
Right, you're Pouf.
Then...
What is my name?
I speak with utmost respect, Your Majesty...
You are the King. You have no other name.
You are the one and only King.
At the moment, there are impostors
using that name without permission,
but we will eliminate them all.
So that the entire world will
know there is only one King.
That assumes the others can be eliminated.
"King" is a title.
A title can be bestowed, and it is not a name.
What of you, Youpi?
Your question is far beyond my capacity.
I cannot think of a way to provide an answer.
Pitou.
I believe that your feelings
are what matter most.
You should select the name
that you find most pleasing.
Very well, then.
You can choose a name after the selection.
Right now, our priority is to finish all the
preparations before tomorrow morning.
Your Majesty, is something wrong?
If you have any concerns, we shall address them.
That is why we are here.
Komugi's entire body was glowing.
Komugi?
The girl with the closed eyes.
He's remembered that human's name.
She experienced an awakening.
Komugi will now become much stronger,
although only at Gungi.
Pitou...
Yes.
If Komugi were put through the selection
that will occur tomorrow, what would happen?
She would die.
The selection chooses humans
with the physical and mental
strength to serve as soldiers.
The survivors will be those who demonstrate
excellent combat capabilities.
Your Majesty, please...
After meeting Komugi,
I've learned that strength can
manifest in different ways.
For example, during our trip here...
Your Majesty, please stop.
...I killed a child.
Your Majesty, you must not say it...
Perhaps that child...
It isn't right... It's inappropriate!
...had the potential to surpass
me in a certain field.
An almighty King...
Yet I extinguished that potential.
...can never show regret!
I extinguished it for no real reason.
You must not say any more!
I am...
King!
I took a life for no reason at all...
What tremendous strength I must possess!
I appear with no warning, to rob
countless beings of their inferior strength!
To crush... To destroy.
That is my power.
Brute force is the strongest
power in this world!
I am not worthy of being a Royal Guard...
Why not?
I jumped to the wrong conclusion,
and I nearly insulted the King.
I was foolish enough to think that the King
might have regretted his actions...
You always think too much.
Yes, that is correct.
Well, the King has changed since that girl arrived.
Yes, that is true.
If the girl will impede the King,
we should kill her.
To think my mind operates
on the same level as yours...
Yes...
My power is the strongest that exists.
All other power means nothing
in the face of my own.
They are as dust in the wind.
Komugi... That female is no different.
Her skill is in Gungi, a simple board game.
I could turn her into no more than
a source of meat with the barest touch.
So her life depends on my mood.
If I change my mind,
I can immediately kill her!
Then why am I so hesitant?
The goal was to kill time while
waiting for the selection.
The selection is tomorrow...
Haven't I had enough?
I've had my fun. I no longer need her.
Do I kill her now?!
Th-Thank you very much...
Why did you not call for help?
Here...
And here...
You're covered in blood!
Damn, I don't believe it.
She's such a fragile creature!
Because it's still early...
I don't want to bother anyone else.
You aren't bothering anyone.
What am...
You are an important guest!
...I saying?
Didn't I come here to kill her?
Why do you cry?!
Why can't I do it?
I'm sorry!
But... But...
No one's ever been this nice to me!
What is this creature?
What do I want
to do with her?
Next time: Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.
Killua-sama, all these marvelous ideas
keep flooding into my mind—
Then we're covered for future preview segments!
﻿Th-Thank you very much...
Why did you not call for help?
Here...
And here...
You're covered in blood!
What is this creature?
What do I want
to do with her?
Taking Stock x And x Taking Action
One day remains before the selection.
The capital city, Peijing, wakes to a quiet morning.
Good morning.
You boys are up early.
We have nineteen hours until
midnight strikes on selection day.
Tonight, we finally make our move.
Let's do one final check.
Once inside, Gon and I
immediately head up the central stairway,
toward the throne room.
Yep.
Ikalgo will take
the northeast elevator down to the
basement, to search for Palm.
If you find her, escape without us.
Right.
If the King and his three Royal Guards
are in the throne room,
we proceed with the plan.
The problem is, what if they're not there?
You're really hung up on that...
What are the chances of that happening?
Well, it's highly unlikely.
But the unusual happens pretty often.
Aren't you contradicting yourself?
We researched the enemy's behavior extensively
before deciding on a day for the attack.
When you're waiting for someone to be
in a certain place, at a certain time,
that's typically when the unexpected happens.
In my old job, I saw this all the time.
The unusual always happens
on the day you've chosen.
In my old job, I could wait for the next chance,
to ensure my success.
But this time, that isn't an option.
We can't wait.
Once we move, there's no turning back.
A moment's hesitation can mean death!
So we should take time now to decide
how we'll act in different situations.
Even if they aren't in the throne room,
if they're still in the palace, it's okay.
Pitou's En is enough to cover the palace and
its surrounding courtyards, and then some.
So if we sense that creepy aura when we enter,
we'll know that they're there.
From there, we just follow that
sinister aura to where it feels densest,
and they'll be at its center.
The question is what we do if
we don't sense Pitou's aura.
In other words, what we do
if they aren't in the palace.
Or if they're in the palace,
but they aren't using En.
Would they be in the palace,
but not using En to guard the King?
That's what happened when
Knov-san infiltrated the palace!
Huh?
Yes, that's what I can't make sense of.
According to Colt, Knov saw Pouf's aura.
The Royal Guard never leaves the King's side.
So if Pouf was there, the other two were
also in the palace with the King.
Then, why did Pitou stop
using the puppets and En,
leaving Pouf to handle security,
which allowed Knov to infiltrate the palace?
I believe the reason has to do with
how Pitou's power works...
Then we should ask Colt.
Yeah.
I'd guess that during that time,
Pitou was healing someone.
Healing?
I told you that Pitou was the
one who restored Kite, yes?
Thinking back, I don't believe Pitou
used En during that period.
Thus, healing must require a
great deal of concentration.
So while healing someone,
Pitou cannot use En or the puppets.
Now it makes sense.
Which means that someone,
most likely the King or one of the
Royal Guard, was injured and
required healing, so the En
and puppets disappeared.
But hold on...
Who would have been able to
injure one of those monsters?
True...
An internal dispute?
Maybe the King injured one of the Royal Guard?
No, that's impossible.
There is no chance that Pitou
would endanger the King
by removing that En to heal someone else!
I guarantee it.
Which means that the one injured...
...was the King!
I see... What you're saying makes sense.
But then the bigger question
is who injured the King.
The Royal Guard wouldn't harm him.
But other soldiers could never put
so much as a scratch on him.
Yep, so our conclusion was...
The King injured himself?!
Under what circumstances
would that have happened?
We don't know why, but it's the only explanation.
I'll admit that I didn't question our
sudden stroke of luck too much...
But that chance was only possible
under abnormal circumstances.
Are they starting to lose control?
That isn't good...
I'm starting to think something's
going on inside the palace.
We will now begin moving to the palace.
Citizens of sector A-1, assemble in
Diego Plaza at once.
The citizens of the other sectors
should prepare to move out.
Oh, they're starting to file out.
They've begun their march...
Ten hours until midnight, when the selection starts.
In twenty-five hours, tomorrow afternoon at three,
five million humans will fill the palace grounds.
Has the situation in Peijing changed?
I thought it was only one skilled enemy,
but now there are a bunch.
So there are reinforcements.
They may try to use the celebration
as cover to approach us.
Then the danger will be greatest
during the selection.
Yes, since the King will be
participating in the selection.
Our greatest concern is
the King somehow being taken beyond our reach.
Assuming that they have a Nen
user capable of translocation,
and that that person can use the ability
to isolate the King somewhere else...
That means at least one of us must stay
by the King's side during the selection.
The King won't allow it.
As it is, he's been upset by how
close we've stayed to him.
Then we guard him secretly,
without his knowledge.
We need someone to stay just close
enough to monitor his surroundings
while still carrying out his own role in the selection...
Whose size won't attract attention,
who won't get absorbed in an amusing task...
Very well, I am the best choice for this.
Strictly by process of elimination, of course...
What's wrong?
Their presences have completely disappeared.
I can't sense any residual aura.
They must be using Zetsu to hide
among the marching humans.
Hey.
There are so many people...
Around a hundred per building.
They must have been packed inside.
Then if we conceal our presences,
they can only assume that we're
hiding among the citizens.
Maybe they'll cancel the march?
No way.
That would mean delaying or
even canceling the celebration.
Which would imply the King had
accepted defeat and compromised.
The Royal Guard won't let that happen.
The celebration will begin as scheduled,
no matter the cost.
Tomorrow morning, at 3 PM!
And that won't change.
Once the humans began to move,
my puppets could no longer tell them apart...
Should I recall them?
No, giving the enemy free
rein would be dangerous.
Have the puppets join the soldiers that
are guiding the citizens, as a deterrent.
'Sup?
As expected, the puppets have joined the march.
In another hour, those sectors will be deserted.
There are six entrances to the
rooms that lead to the palace.
We'll avoid the entrances in front of the
palace, where security will be tighter,
and wait by entrances A, B,
and C, behind the palace.
Once we've entered the rooms,
the only exit will lead inside the palace.
What? You scared?
Don't be absurd.
I merely want to be sure we're prepared.
Waiting by the entrances involves
quite a lot of risk.
But if we enter the rooms too early,
we won't be able to exit until midnight.
True...
If we receive any useful information,
we want to be free to act on it...
And we can't use cell phones near the palace,
since the Ants will pick up on the signal.
I think it's dangerous to spend hours
waiting inside the rooms,
not knowing if there have been
accidents or changes in the situation.
But you're the one who said it was
risky to wait outside the palace.
Yes...
You shouldn't take their security net lightly.
I'll take care of it.
I'm the only one who can freely
enter and exit these rooms.
If anything happens, I'll tell you.
For now, you should rest here.
Will you be okay?
I shouldn't have any problem
investigating the area...
Even if I'm right beside the palace, as long
as I'm out of range of Pitou's En...
But you should be careful.
Pitou doesn't use a standard circular En.
It changes shape like an amoeba,
giving it extended range.
That's what Kite came in contact with.
And it was probably deliberate...
It's a fighter's instinct to want to know
how strong the opponent is.
And his instinct led him to misjudge their strength.
In some areas, that En can
stretch two kilometers.
Make sure you stay out of range.
Don't worry about it.
In this room, I'm the one who most fears them.
I won't do anything crazy.
I promise you that.
We will now head to the palace.
Any person who leaves their line
will be shot on the spot.
Move out!
Pitou...
You knew that Komugi was being attacked?
Yes, I was monitoring the area with En.
However,
I determined that there was no threat
to Your Majesty, so I ignored it.
From now on, monitor Komugi's surroundings,
and deal with any threats at once.
Yes, as you command.
Tens of thousands of people are marching
in a line toward the King.
Like ants... No, lemmings.
A march of death.
It will be dark soon.
I can tell Morel and the
others to come out...
What is
that?
Wing scales?
The wind is carrying the scales of
his wings toward the citizens...
That means...
As I thought...
They all look completely vacant and dazed.
Those scales have a hypnotic effect.
Stay in line as you advance!
Stay in line!
Once you reach your position, wait for orders.
Do not move!
Simple orders delivered repeatedly,
while tanks roll in the background
can easily seep into a mind exhausted
from hours of marching...
It's the perfect situation for using hypnosis!
Once the selection begins,
and blood starts to fly,
they will continue to quietly stand in place.
Until it's their turn.
Hypnosis? I see...
If they're brainwashed, the citizens won't run.
But this works out for us.
Eh?
If we make a lot of noise,
we won't have to worry about citizens panicking.
Ah!
There won't be any stampede of humans
falling over each other to escape.
That's a big boon.
Assuming that over half of the people
will be in place at midnight,
we would have expected a stampede to
leave tens of thousands of casualties.
Our biggest concern has been addressed.
We can go crazy.
Six hours to go.
Everyone's here.
Have you heard from Palm?
No.
Oh...
We'll keep waiting until half
an hour before go time.
If we knew what's inside before
going in, it'd be very different...
Yeah.
They both look composed.
Killua, in particular, shows
none of the mental weakness he
displayed when we fought.
I'd almost say he's brimming with confidence.
But for some reason,
he seems on the verge of fading away.
No, I don't have time to worry about others.
I'm the one suffering from the most anxiety.
The fate of humanity rests on me...
Colt is a good guy...
Meleoron and Ikalgo both have good hearts.
It doesn't matter if they're humans or Ants.
Everyone has a heart.
That's what I want to believe.
Hopefully, the King also has one.
But some of them must be killed...
If we don't kill them, we'll be killed!
Kite, it's almost time.
I promise to turn you back...
By defeating that Ant.
He's fired up...
I'll focus on providing support.
So no one can interfere in your battle...
Using my new Kanmuru technique.
My body feels heavy.
I'm suffering from days without rest...
On a scale of 1 to 100, my current
condition would be 40...
No, 35...
But I can't be whining now.
With Knov out, I'm the only one left.
I was hoping to fight at full strength,
but it's easier to accept my fate this way.
I'll focus on playing the decoy and
drawing my target from the King.
I'm sorry, Morel and everyone...
But I can't bring myself to go.
I'll take a look outside.
So two minutes is the longest
I can hold my breath...
Given how tense I'll be inside, my limit
will probably be, at most, half that.
Good enough...
One minute is more than enough time!
Tomorrow, at midnight, I will be reborn.
A few days ago, I couldn't have
dreamed of such a life.
Thank you, Killua.
I promise to carry out my mission for you!
Tomorrow will be my birthday!
I am the King.
But who am I?
Why was I brought into this world?
Time's up... Let's go!
Palm...
Ten minutes remain until
they enter the palace.
Next time: Confusion x And x Expectation.
It's so cold, Gon...
They said Admiral Winter is coming!
I think you mean General Winter.
﻿Facing the palace, each of the three exits
is progressively closer to the throne room.
Okay, we're all agreed.
We'll all use the closest exit,
and bust in from beside the central stairway.
Confusion x And x Expectation
This seemed like a good idea
since Leol-sama praised me so much,
but dispelling Nen is hard.
And the stronger the Nen,
the bigger my stomach gets.
This was a bad idea.
To a girl, there's nothing
worse than losing your figure.
I should ask Leol-sama for a larger reward!
Right, Shidore?
Having a peon that understands
speech is useful, but...
You really need to talk more.
You have permission to shoot her on sight!
As a foreigner, she can't blend
in with the other citizens!
Damn! Damn that woman!
What does she want?
Hey!
How many times have I told you
not to use your cell phone here?
The radio waves irritate my ears,
and it gives me a headache!
Plus, I can hear what you're saying.
Next time I catch you, I'll snap your
phone and your arm in half.
W-Well... There are urgent matters
that must be dealt with.
I need to use my phone.
It's so urgent that you find
the woman who ran away?
I can find her for you.
R-Really?
My nose happens to be very sharp...
If you have something she wore, I can track her.
The Royal Guard appreciates the work you do,
and I respect you, as well!
So, a little give-and-take will benefit us both here.
O-Okay!
Hold on, and I'll bring you something.
I will become the King behind the scenes.
To accomplish that, I must be friendly
with Bizeff, not with the King.
Welfin-sama, an urgent alert has been issued.
Bah.
When peons send transmissions,
it gives me a headache.
This smells like...
Taragette's blood.
There are bloodstains and dirty shoes.
An intruder!
If he took his shoes off here
to avoid leaving footprints,
he must be somewhere deeper within.
He didn't hide his shoes because
he had a pressing mission and
couldn't afford to lose time...
That day last week, when it rained?
That was the day Taragette went missing.
I'm pretty sure that the intruder killed him.
But that means he disposed of Taragette's body
while leaving his shoes behind.
There's no blood trail nearby.
If he wrapped the body in something to move it,
he must have come prepared.
Was kidnapping a soldier his mission?
Why would they do that?!
Damn, I don't get this!
Should I ask Shaiapouf for advice?
No, I'll catch the intruder,
and get the answers from him.
He did head inside the palace!
This guy comes before Bizeff's woman...
Follow me!
What is your name?
It's K-K-Komugi.
Can you please tell me what your name is?
I didn't get to learn his name...
I can't wait to play him again!
Who am I?
A nameless king... in a borrowed castle.
My subjects are mindless puppets.
If this is the fate that the
heavens have granted me...
I have no doubt that I shall
be slowly bored to death!
Don't follow me.
Yes, but—
Do not make me repeat myself.
Now we've all been beaten by the King.
The King says your En is irritating him.
I figured he would be saying that soon.
But I can't remove our security...
Then you go and tell him that!
I don't want another beating.
How does this sound?
We can block all aura in a radius
surrounding Your Majesty.
This way, my presence will not bother you.
Are you telling me to stay in one place?
Given that keeping
the aura-free zone around me
while I move wouldn't be possible.
I refuse to have my movement
constantly monitored.
No, that would not be our proposal.
So if I do not wish to deal with your presence,
I will only be able to move
within that confined area.
I must order you to move that zone
should I wish to go elsewhere?
There is nothing more I can say.
Keep your En focused outside the palace.
I shall put up with that until tomorrow's selection.
Are you dissatisfied?
Should that not suffice to guard
against outside attacks?
Or are you saying that there
are already enemies inside?
That would be admitting that your En
is completely worthless, would it not?
You're absolutely correct.
If my En is focused only outside, it cannot detect
any attack from underground.
In addition,
my En is not capable of recognizing
an enemy that is already inside.
Do you mean Komugi?
No, eleven soldiers still remain within the palace,
and they are free to enter and leave at will.
A check is performed each time someone enters,
but if the soldier were being
controlled by the enemy,
it would be difficult to know for sure.
That means—
Enough.
You may use En on the first floor of the palace!
That will permit you to guard
against any underground attack!
Tell everyone that no one is allowed
on the second floor or above.
Should an intruder come, I shall
deal with them personally.
Likewise, you will not come unless summoned!
If you disturb me, it will
have violent consequences!
The other Ants
were never allowed on or above the second floor...
But where do I go now?
The central stairway connecting the
first and second floors, I suppose...
If an intruder comes from underground,
you will be in position to deal with them.
Still, the King's been in a bad mood lately.
Is he upset about losing
all those Gungi matches?
I have an idea as to the cause of his irritation.
My ability, Spiritual Message, would be
able to confirm my suspicions.
However, that would be an insult to the King!
No, I'm just making excuses...
The truth is that I'm afraid.
So afraid of what it is
that grows inside the King even as we speak,
I cannot bear it...
Tsk, the rain washed away the scent.
But now I have the answer.
The intruder hid here to
check the second floor,
but instead of going upstairs, he exited.
Something made him give up his mission?
Or did he accomplish his objective?
No, he may have used his power!
I should probably warn you...
If any of you go to the second
floor, the King will kill you.
Tell everyone else in the palace.
Yes, sir.
Wings!
What if the intruder has the power to fly?
The shoes and scent could have
been there to mislead us.
He could have flown up to the second floor!
Youpi-dono...
Huh?
Uh, er...
Pitou is monitoring the palace with En.
If they'd gone to the second floor,
they would have been caught...
Ah, sorry... It's not important.
Huh?
That doesn't make sense!
Then how did the intruder reach the stairway?!
Youpi-dono...
Huh? What is it?
Has Pitou-dono ever ceased to use En?
For example, that day last week when it rained?
What? You didn't hear what happened?
There was a huge uproar...
The King tore off his own arm!
Pitou had to heal the King,
so Pouf was using his En instead.
How wide is his En?
I wouldn't know about that...
Wouldn't it be just as large as Pitou's?
No, I'd guess that Pouf's En only
reached as far as the stairway.
The intruder saw that aura,
and gave up on ascending!
That all makes sense.
The question is what the
intruder's objective was,
and whether he's still hiding around here.
Do I tell Youpi?
No, I can't do that...
I should report this to Pitou or Pouf.
Pouf would be the best choice.
And if possible, I need to determine
what the intruder's objective was.
Otherwise, my report would be
that the intruder somehow
made it inside the palace,
but turned and ran when he felt Pouf's En.
I won't get any credit.
I can make up an objective,
but if the intruder is captured,
they'll find out I lied.
But if I tell the Royal Guard my suspicions
and the intruder is never found,
it would only waste their time
and damage my own standing.
Is that Bizeff's cell phone again?!
I have a great idea...
So the intruder captured one of my men.
According to Leol, that intruder
has the ability to teleport.
I believe that he and the
woman are working together.
They probably teleported out together.
Damn, but why would they do that?
Yes, that's the question.
However, I've discerned their objective.
What is it?
To blow up the palace.
That's a lie.
What?
We must tell the Royal Guard!
Wait.
Don't be in such a rush.
We can tell them after we've found the bomb.
There's no time!
Calm down, and consider this
from their perspective...
Eh?
If they want to blow up the palace,
they'll wait until they're sure the King is here.
When would that be?
When all the citizens have assembled...
Right before the ceremony begins!
There will be five million humans!
What a sight that will be to see...
Just imagine looking down on them!
The King would not allow a double
to steal that gratification from him!
So he will be there in person!
It's only logical to assume the enemy
reached the same conclusion.
True...
I've stood at the former Supreme Leader's
side for many of these celebrations...
The experience brings indescribable
pleasure beyond even sexual gratification.
We still have over half a day
before the ceremony.
If I use my nose to track the intruder,
we can find the bomb with time to spare.
If we have proof when we report to the
Royal Guard, we'll look much better.
If we save the King's life, they'll be quite grateful.
Right?
Yes... That's true.
As soon as I find the bomb, I'll contact you.
Okay, that sounds good.
The coward finally calmed down?
I'm getting closer to becoming
the King behind the scenes!
Seven minutes to go.
I'll give a call when it's down to one minute.
Assemble near the exit then.
Until then, stand by.
Meleoron, about your power...
I know.
I'll tap your shoulder ten seconds
before I need to breathe...
And then, I'll tap you again when
I start to hold my breath again!
You don't need to push your limits.
You should catch your breath
whenever you need to.
When God's Accomplice isn't active,
you can trust me to handle things.
Why don't you have a smoke?
If you underestimate their sense
of smell, you'll die quickly...
Tracking someone by the smell of
cigarette smoke is simple for them.
We could be knocked out the
second I take my first breath...
The boss will be putting up a smokescreen
when we go in. It'll be fine.
I know, but I'd rather avoid unnecessary risk.
I don't want to regret my decision.
The Royal Guard is on the move.
The three of them gathered above the
front gate to discuss something.
Pitou stayed there, and Youpi went back inside.
Pouf returned to the air to scatter his scales,
so I don't think anything has changed.
I'll let you know if anything else happens.
Yeah, until we leave, feed us as
much information as you can.
Essentially, that eliminates the
possibility of the Royal Guard
being out of the palace.
Essentially, but not completely...
Well, I guarantee that they'll be near the King.
You can't guarantee anything.
We have to be prepared for any possibility,
or we'll be slow to react when
something goes wrong!
You only say that because you don't
understand how loyal they are.
It's impossible that they'd leave the King!
The Royal Guard is always with the King!
And it's fine to believe that!
But we should prepare for any exceptions!
Give me an example of one
of these exceptions!
There are all kinds of exceptions!
Honestly, how can they be having
a dispute at the last second?
You're being too unrealistic!
One exception could be a woman...
Isn't one of the King's objectives to reproduce?
I wasn't sure what the King was doing in
the palace, but he was reproducing.
That must be it.
I see...
That would give the King a reason to keep
the Royal Guard from his bedroom...
Perhaps Bizeff was bringing
women in for the King.
Palm and the King?!
We're sticking to the plan...
No matter what's happening to Palm!
Gon has no idea what they're talking about.
I'm glad we realized this before we set out.
If we'd seen something like
that without warning,
we'd have frozen in our tracks.
Get it now?
You can never overthink something.
There are probably other unexpected
situations that we haven't considered yet.
Yes, something is still bothering me.
Gon...
Do you understand?
Let Palm take care of herself!
No matter what you see,
you must stay focused on Pitou.
Yeah!
It bothers me, but whether
a woman's involved or not,
I believe we should be prepared
for a third party in the palace.
I have a feeling that the third party
is causing my anxiety.
Why did the King injure himself?
Hold on...
That was just a theory of yours.
Yeah, but you agreed that there
was no other logical explanation.
You're contradicting yourself...
Didn't you say there could be other exceptions?
Following that logic,
Pitou could have stopped using En
for other, unexpected reasons.
I understand that...
But something doesn't feel right.
With three minutes left to go, is this
something worth thinking about?
Yeah.
Yeah, think about it...
When would you try to hurt yourself?
When I couldn't forgive myself...
When you couldn't forgive yourself?
That's the logical conclusion...
But that would mean the King
is a ruler with personal pride,
and not just a cold tyrant.
True.
For the sake of his pride, he's willing to endure pain.
Speaking from experience,
people like him will never
be willing to compromise.
If the leader refuses to compromise,
neither will the Royal Guard.
You should assume that combat
will be our only option!
Morel was able to sum everything up...
But he's wrong.
The King's self-injury...
The third party...
We still haven't correctly
deduced what happened.
I have a feeling...
that the truth has the potential
to completely ruin our plans!
It's time!
One minute to go.
Gather around.
Damn! We're out of time...
At ten seconds left, I'll begin the countdown.
Let's do this, boys.
Get ready to rumble!
Next time: Charge x And x Invade.
Yeah, hot pots are great in winter...
Which reminds me of mystery pots.
Charge into the pot!
I think you mean toss into the pot...
﻿The King's self-injury...
The third party...
We still haven't correctly
deduced what happened.
I have a feeling...
At worst, the answer we find could
potentially ruin all of our plans.
It's time!
One minute to go.
Gather around.
Damn! We're out of time...
Charge x And x Invade
Two minutes before Morel
issued the call to attack...
Two men leaped from a giant bird flying high over
the Republic of East Gorteau.
Pitou was the first one to notice.
The only reason Pitou decided to look up
was "just because."
Pitou's hunch was just that faint.
Something is coming.
However, a few seconds later,
that hunch turned to certainty.
The enemy.
But at that point, the enemy was still very high up.
Too high for even Pitou's
exceptional senses to ascertain.
Pitou's decision to prepare for battle
was based solely on primal instinct.
Pitou's En...
has vanished.
Two of the Royal Guard almost
simultaneously spotted the approaching form.
A dragon!
At the Same Time
Ten seconds to go.
Nine!
Eight!
Seven.
As Morel counted down to the attack,
Killua alone noticed that Gon's eyes sank
to a deep, dark, silent coldness beside him.
Six...
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
This was when Pitou ceased using En,
in order to prepare for the coming fight.
However...
One.
Go!
Your Majesty!
Dragon Meteor Shower
Dragon Dive
Dragon Dive.
The sighting of the enemy
and the decision to stop using En
in preparation for battle had backfired.
Where are they?
Faced with a serious threat to the King,
Pitou's six senses, sharpened to their limits,
immediately focused on the intruders.
The countless dragons that rained
down were less significant threats
than the humans in the sky.
Terpsichora!
Puppet Master's Serenity
Terpsichora
Pitou uses this Nen ability when
full power is required to fight.
It takes less than a tenth of a second
after activation to launch the attack.
However, during that fraction of a second,
Pitou could hear Netero speaking.
I prepared for a variety of responses.
But you've made a bad move, little Ant.
Bad Move
It really happens.
You don't think it's possible.
But it is.
It's like when your life flashes before your eyes.
When you know you're about to die, you feel
as though time slows, and you review your life.
It's just like that.
In fact, I'd consider this
phenomenon even more credible.
Because you can hear what
the other person is thinking.
You can even obtain information
known only to the other person.
There is proof that it worked.
Martial artists call this "listening with the spirit."
Listening with the Spirit
It's a time perception paradox that occurs
commonly when two skilled warriors clash.
The secret behind the old man's strength?
I can think of a few possibilities.
First, his Nen is very quiet.
No one can predict his next
attack by reading his aura.
He's lived a long time for a reason.
He has a plant's mental toughness.
Hell, he was an old man when
I was still breast feeding.
He's the only man to fight my grandpa and survive.
I'd consider him an acquaintance.
We are like yin and yang.
Fool, we aren't evenly matched.
He always has the upper hand.
What?
The secret behind his strength?
I guess there's also that...
When it comes to battle,
he has the Hundred-type Guanyin Bodhisattva.
That is his most dangerous ability.
Netero's sequential movements appeared
exceedingly gradual and fluid to Pitou.
No
No...
There was no doubt that
Netero's motions had ended
in the moment between Pitou's Nen
activation and subsequent attack.
Essentially, this required the
constriction of time perception,
almost to the point of stopping
time entirely for Pitou alone,
in order to perceive Netero's actions.
In other words, the result was...
an attack that could not be dodged.
Netero, forty-six years old,
in the dead of winter.
Sensing that he had reached his limits
of both body and technique,
he spent much time in contemplation
before he reached an answer.
Gratitude
That answer was gratitude.
Amen...
He owed a debt to the martial arts
that had helped him to mature.
The method he came up with to
repay that debt as best he could...
was to throw 10,000 punches of gratitude every day.
He would calm himself,
worship,
pray,
ready himself,
then punch.
At first, completing the sequence
took five or six seconds.
On the first day, he required over 18
hours to complete 10,000 punches.
Upon completion, he'd fall asleep on the spot.
When he awoke, he resumed
punching, day after day.
After two years, he noticed a difference.
After he'd completed 10,000 punches,
the sun was still up.
At age fifty, he had made a perfect metamorphosis.
He managed to complete 10,000
punches of gratitude
in under an hour.
This left him more time for prayer.
When Netero came down from
the mountains, his fists
were faster than sound.
Was that my imagination?
For a moment, he seemed to disappear...
I didn't hear anything until after...
Master?
La—
Lady Guanyin...
So...
Are you willing to defend your school?
I offer you my school.
Please accept me as a student!
A monster was born.
Sure, if you give me something to eat.
This happened over six decades ago.
Considering where his hands stopped,
the attack shouldn't come from there...
How?!
I hope that you will not return.
This will force me a long distance away!
Your Majesty!
Pouf!
He can't hear me...
He's too worried about the King.
Doctor Blythe!
By its nature, this ability could
only be used for healing.
Doctor Blythe cannot move from
its initial summoned position.
Since the puppet is connected to Pitou's tail,
Pitou must stay within twenty meters.
That restriction
kept Pitou in the fight.
I've stopped?
Quickly...
Quickly!
Midnight
There, they encountered someone they
hadn't counted on seeing at this point.
It was Youpi.
Next time: Monster x And x Monster.
Roar! I'm gonna eat you!
Go ahead and try!
Chomp.
Ow! Payback time!
Chomp chomp!
Chomp chomp chomp chomp chomp chomp!
Chomp chomp!
﻿Midnight
Monster x And x Monster
The moment Killua entered the palace...
I knew it!
...was his reaction.
He couldn't sense Pitou's En at all,
and before him stood Youpi, whom nobody had
expected to encounter on the first floor.
Despite the fact that they were now
in a situation that was utterly
unforeseen in their planning,
Killua's experience helped him stay calm.
Who are these guys?
Where did they come from?
From Youpi's perspective, too,
his current situation was an impossibility.
Youpi immediately ceased all thought.
I am a shield.
I protect the King with my body.
Of the Royal Guard, Youpi alone was
created from Magical Beasts, not humans.
Perhaps that was why
he lacked the self-preservative
nature of the other two Royal Guard.
However, that lack also gave him strength.
The moment Youpi changed
forms with a belligerent smile,
Shoot froze at once.
However, it wasn't because
Shoot was slow to react.
If I move any closer, he will attack.
And if his attack happens to connect with
the invisible Knuckle and Meleoron...
In order to draw Youpi's attention toward himself,
he began to move his cage and floating arms...
And then it happened.
This is Dragon Dive!
Then the old man's friend is...
Only Killua understood what was happening,
and it momentarily froze him.
The shock was even greater to those
who didn't know what was going on.
There were only two present,
Gon and Youpi, who remained focused
on the enemy that faced them.
No way!
Has he lost it?
You aren't supposed to fight Youpi...
No, wait.
Realization came a moment later to Killua,
and still a few moments later to the others.
Seriously, even in this situation,
how did he realize that, and so quickly?
If Meleoron and Knuckle were to
be pierced by a Dragon Lance
while God's Accomplice was
active, and die instantly,
would their invisibility cease?
Or would the Nen remain, leaving them to
decompose without anyone ever knowing?
No one knew the answer.
Assuming the latter, confirming whether they
were still alive would be impossible.
Meaning that, in the worst-case
scenario, someone else would
have to deal with Youpi.
That should have been my job...
Gon!
Shoot did nothing wrong.
Even I was later than Killua
in noticing and reacting.
Shoot, don't blame yourself...
Pull yourself together!
If Gon and Killua are taking Youpi,
you're left with Pitou!
However,
Shoot was feeling a completely
different emotion at that moment.
Gon!
I want to tell the entire world...
"This is Gon!
A boy less than half my age,
to whom I owe my life."
I've always gone to any lengths
to avoid facing danger and risk,
hiding myself within a safe cage,
where no one could hurt me.
I hated myself for it...
But I couldn't change myself.
Friends and teachers encouraged me,
but I never truly listened,
considering it the logic of the strong.
Yet somehow...
A boy with less than half my strength
managed to break my cage!
Shoot did indeed tend to shrink
back weakly from opportunity.
I will survive...
So that I can thank you!
However, even he didn't realize that
such unique turns in his train of thought
made him shine in the face of adversity.
Good!
Knuckle and Meleoron...
...are alive!
What?
Who was it that just attacked me?
I couldn't see a thing...
Did someone fire a projectile from my blind spot?
Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, activate!
Naturally, they had already tested
to confirm that God's Accomplice
would be compatible with Chapter 7 Bankruptcy.
As long as God's Accomplice stayed active,
Youpi would be unable to see APR.
Thus, it was natural that Youpi would question
what had just happened, rather than
concentrate on the enemies before him.
I can't sense any damage or abnormal effect.
Which means my focus right now should be...
So far, everything had proceeded
according to the Hunters' plan.
However, after a successful first strike,
Knuckle could only shudder.
Seriously?
It's like his aura is unlimited!
After surviving over five thousand battles,
Knuckle had the experience and intuition
to quantify his opponent's strength.
It was not uncommon for him to
face enemies who were stronger
than previous opponents he had encountered.
However, there was no comparing
the power he now faced
to that of the opponents who had come before.
A monster with an immense amount of aura.
Five times what the boss has?
Ten times?
More?
I can't tell!
He had never experienced anything like this.
Assuming he's ten times stronger,
with 700,000 aura,
how long will it take before he goes bust?
The King!
That was when
the Hunters felt
the full brunt of Pitou's sinister aura.
Youpi immediately noticed
that momentary hesitation.
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
Since Pitou lacked wings,
the only option was to continue free falling.
This was actually a stroke of luck.
Had there been unlimited courses of action,
Pitou would have joined Pouf and
rushed straight toward the King,
a Royal Guard's natural reaction.
In that scenario, it's unlikely
that Pitou would have had
the presence of mind to use En.
As a result...
The guest room on the second
floor of the west tower...
The King is with the woman with closed eyes.
They're also using En to locate the King!
This was when Pitou realized the
seriousness of the situation.
In that instant, Pitou crouched like the
four-legged creature of the Ant's origin,
with upper legs tensing like steel
until they were twice as large as they'd
been before the attack on Kite.
In order to reach the King
before the enemy could.
But a second later...
A wave of negative energy from Pitou's destination
was strong enough to make
Pitou regret the decision.
This is...
the King's...
The aura coming from the King
was so unmasked, his current state
of mind was plain to read.
As a result, Pitou could only conclude
that the situation had grown
even worse than previously thought.
The main stairway had collapsed!
When the King looked down,
time began to move again.
However, time remained frozen for everyone else.
The intruders, who had come for the King's life,
were holding their breath and standing still
because of the girl covered in blood.
And because the grotesque
creature holding her body
was clearly treating her with tenderness and care.
Pitou.
Y-Yes, sir.
The expression on the King's face
had returned to normal.
This only increased Pitou's concern.
Heal Komugi.
I'm counting on you.
The two veterans continued to stand by,
silently watching their enemies,
out of respect.
This was an act of love for a life.
Should they infringe upon that act,
their cause was lost.
It would have been inhumane.
This isn't what I was given to expect.
For Zeno to make that comment was only natural.
Netero felt the same way.
Not here.
Let us go elsewhere.
I believe that a different location
would be to your benefit, as well.
Netero had spent a great deal of money
to enlist Zeno to help separate
the King from the Royal Guard.
He had no reason to object to the King's proposal.
However...
Well, I suppose.
He could not help but feel
he had lost the initiative...
Doctor Blythe.
The moment Pitou's ability was activated,
the two men thought that their decision
to lower their guard would prove fatal.
Because the King was able to walk
between them with ease.
Their opponent, also, was an incredible monster.
Next time: An x Indebted x Insect.
Gon, what are you eating?
Oh, it's candy. Gummy insects.
I-Insects that are candy?
﻿The King!
An x Indebted x Insect
Youpi's attack separated the Hunters.
The central stairway was destroyed,
with Youpi awaiting anyone still looking to ascend.
Behind him were Knuckle and Meleoron,
who had barely managed to
make it to the second floor.
Below,
the ones hit at closest range
by Youpi's attack were Shoot...
This is bad.
My leg's destroyed.
Shoot!
...and Morel.
The rest is up to you.
Knuckle...
He couldn't say Knuckle's name out loud.
Stupid tricks!
One attack by Youpi
tore apart the Deep Purple puppets,
but Morel had deliberately
positioned them with that in mind.
They were just decoys?
That resistance...
This is more than smoke!
The weapon was the only
thing that wasn't smoke?
Fool! You won't get away!
After using his own weapon as a decoy,
Morel had no option left but to run.
But...
Knuckle knew exactly what he had to do.
Chapter 7 Bankruptcy!
That...
That punch was meant to send
him flying over the horizon.
The total is 590?
Ten seconds feels like an eternity now...
Chapter 7 Bankruptcy applies additional damage
in the form of interest as time progresses
from the activation of the ability.
Lost sight of him...
Damn you!
The enraged Youpi
returned to his senses because his multiple
eyes had caught sight of a shadowed form.
With his right leg broken,
Shoot unconsciously used his remaining
leg to stand on one of his own fists.
Despite that he had never attempted it before,
Shoot realized that this was his ultimate technique.
And he had no clear reason
to cover his right eye.
He was just enjoying the fact
that he continued to gain strength
while the situation deteriorated.
Fueled by adversity itself,
Shoot took flight.
His tremendous speed and vigor
succeeded in forcing Youpi to
concentrate on defense for a few seconds.
All in order
to help the others.
Shoot, Knuckle...
Once we finish this, first thing we do
is drink ourselves silly with good alcohol.
That's the only way I can get you guys
to let me give you a big hug.
The debris cloud raised by the destruction
was the perfect cover for Morel to expand
his smoke aura throughout the palace
so he could monitor the course of the battle.
Morel's objective was the throne room.
When Youpi destroyed the central stairway,
Gon and Killua evaded the attack
and changed direction.
They planned to jump from
the east tower's second floor to the central
tower's third floor, where the throne room was.
Upon hitting the ground, they passed
Ikalgo in the courtyard as he headed
for the elevator underground.
His ability that let him control corpses
like part of his own body,
Living Dead Dolls, granted him
the use of multiple sets of eyes,
which had allowed him to
dodge Dragon Dive unscratched.
In the corner of his eye, Killua spotted
two soldier Ants in the direction
that Ikalgo was headed.
In the next moment, Killua had taken off.
Killua?
Why is he heading toward the elevator?
What am I doing?
What's wrong with me?
It was only natural that Killua would
be surprised by his own actions.
He was the one
who had instructed the others
to stick to their own tasks.
At that point, Killua's mind completely froze.
However, while his mind panicked,
his body continued to move efficiently,
keeping aura usage to a minimum,
while swiftly and accurately
gauging the two soldier Ants' abilities
and movements, and halting them.
Only Ikalgo and one other
saw what had happened.
Damn...
What have I
done?
Killua,
I owe you one.
After he realized what he'd done,
a tangle of emotions
had left Killua lost in confusion,
until Ikalgo's words woke him.
By the time the two Ants' remains hit the floor,
Killua was already moving on.
Flutter?
Something's wrong.
At either end of the hall leading to the
elevator underground were the servant quarters,
which soldier Ants currently occupied.
Ikalgo raced past the two Ants,
and at the moment when he reached the elevator,
the doors at both ends opened simultaneously.
From the doors appeared...
Cheetu...
Brovada!
After seeing Flutter,
Welfin had hidden because he'd smelled
that something was wrong.
That was too fast.
Once they spotted the enemy,
the two soldiers raised an alert.
Right afterward, they were killed.
The time between the intruder's
return down the hallway
and Flutter's appearance was too short!
Which means they must have passed
one another in the hallway.
Then why were the soldiers killed,
but not Flutter?
Is Flutter on the enemy's side?
Meaning...
He's a traitor!
Is he acting on his own, or...
Is it Hagya's... Or rather...
Leol's orders?
This is pathetic.
When he needed me most, I wasn't there.
And I call myself a Royal Guard?
I don't even know where the King is.
And I call myself a Royal Guard?
No.
I am a failure!
It's that simple...
Pouf's loyalty made him both strong and weak.
The ideals he prioritized were
unyielding and absolute.
Pouf, the former Royal Guard.
Now, Pouf...
Useless Pouf...
You utter fool.
You failure of a Royal Guard!
Where will you go now?
You have no idea?
And if the King isn't there,
then you'll be more useless
than scum, won't you?
No, useless Pouf...
You just refuse to accept reality.
You don't want him spending
time with that woman!!!!
You don't want him spending
time with that woman!
His emotions were directed at
the King as well as himself.
An absolute King,
feeling concern for a lowly human...
Visiting the room of a lowly human by choice...
It is unforgivable!
But...
That's probably where the King is...
Before I came here, I knew that much.
I didn't fail as a Royal Guard because
I didn't know the King's location.
I failed because I knew where,
and I didn't go there!
Yes, Pouf, you traitor, lower than scum.
You are now a mere bug!
You can no longer expect anything of yourself.
Nor are you allowed, then,
to expect anything of the King!
I can only work for the King...
For the King... For the King...
For the King... For the King...
For the King! For the King! For the King!
For the King!
For the King!
Instead, his emotions, bordering on fanaticism,
prevented him from thinking clearly in the
seconds after he arrived in the throne room.
I must go to the King.
Yo.
You're gonna ignore me?!
He goes straight to the King without a glance.
Unfortunately, you've been surrounded.
What must I do
to have you let me out?
Oh, I'm not letting you out.
I see...
Spiritual Message
Love Spring of Moth Scales
Spiritual Message.
That's Morel's Smoky Jail...
The ability he's using to separate
Pouf from the King.
If the third floor of the tower
is surrounded by smoke,
the King and Pitou aren't there.
Where are they?
Gon was raring to fight.
Next time: Divide x And x Conquer.
No, I don't wanna leave you!
It's okay! We're connected
by an invisible bond!
There you go againâ€”
Two sides of the same coin.
Two peas in a pod!
﻿That's Morel's Smoky Jail...
The ability he's using to separate
Pouf from the King.
If the third floor of the tower
is surrounded by smoke,
the King and Pitou aren't there.
Where are they?
Divide x And x Conquer
Each has begun his own battle
in his own respective location.
Gon...
Grandpa!
Which means that that's...
the King!
Proceed.
I am fully aware that you seek
to accomplish your objective
with minimal human casualties.
You took advantage of the chaos in the palace
in order to separate my Royal Guard from me.
It makes no difference.
Proceed.
Dragon Head!
He is frightening...
The technique he unleashed was
not intended to hurt the King.
And both of them could tell that the King
realized this at once.
Zeno made certain that his Nen
was completely neutral.
Was it a gesture of respect? Or was it...
Killua...
Pitou is over there.
Let's go!
Let's go...
In what sense did you mean that?
Killua barely managed to stop himself
from asking the question.
If I ask that question,
I won't be able to stop anymore...
I won't be able to go back.
If Killua would just ask, he would have his answer.
Anyone with enough experience
would easily arrive at that next step.
But the fear of losing someone he cared for
prevented him from taking that step.
A few moments before the dragon took flight,
Cheetu and Brovada appeared
before Ikalgo.
Hey, it's Flutter.
What's with all the noise?
Pitou-dono's En disappeared again.
I just returned...
It seems the enemy is attacking.
Seriously?
Well, I couldn't imagine anything else causing this.
What happened to your wings?
Oh, uh...
I lost them earlier, during the attack.
Are you going underground?
Y-Yeah, I have orders from Hagya-sama.
What should we do?
Well, we weren't told to defend this place...
But I'm just itching to try
my new technique.
It's huge...
That looks fun!
I'm gonna check it out!
Be careful!
I'm gonna see what's going on!
Then, I'll be going.
Okay.
"Hagya-sama"?
Meanwhile, in the throne room,
in the central tower...
Is it truly possible
to trap me in one place?
Why don't we find out?
Wing scales...
Knov said that they can hypnotize people.
I don't want to inhale any...
You seem to be finished talking.
I would expect that of anyone
with considerable power.
However...
Caution, resolve,
and confidence in a 2:3:5 ratio.
His caution isn't as strong
because he's confident.
It's safe to say he has a strong personality.
Pouf's Spiritual Message
surrounds his opponent with wing scales,
making their aura more opaque,
letting him sense their state of mind.
I suppose I should introduce myself.
I am Shaiapouf, one of the King's Royal Guard.
His caution has increased slightly.
You won't tell me your name?
If you believe that I'm trying
to trick you into inhaling my wing
scales, you're sadly mistaken.
And to be honest, I'm a little shocked.
After a rebirth, all will be forgotten.
I'll need you to wait a moment.
If he wants to waste time, that's fine by me.
No matter what sort of beast he emerges as...
Shoot was fighting recklessly,
without concern for his life,
which turned out to be the
reason he was still alive.
Hotel Rafflesia...
While barely dodging multiple attacks that
would have been otherwise lethal,
Shoot had only managed to take
the eye on Youpi's shoulder.
He had essentially done no damage.
However...
Youpi was unable to finish off his opponent.
The strange sensation that his momentum
was being stolen, rather than stopped,
influenced Youpi's mental state tremendously.
After taking multiple hits from
attacks he didn't understand,
Youpi was backing up.
I can't let this guy near the King.
Every second I keep him away
from the King counts.
Youpi and Shoot shared the same objective.
However, this expected turn of events
was difficult on Knuckle...
Hold it in...
I can't attack now!
If I attack now, I'll be broadcasting
that there's one more enemy
he needs to worry about!
Hold it in!
Shoot was now covered in blood,
as he endured Youpi's ferocious
barrage of attacks.
Forced to watch from the sidelines,
just remaining hidden was a battle.
No matter how he told himself to keep still...
Hold it in... Please hold it in!
Knuckle was unable to hold back the
tears streaming down his face.
You can do it!
It's time.
Adding interest.
Only ten seconds have passed?
You're kidding!
How much longer do I have to endure
this suffocating, excruciating wait
that makes me want to do nothing but run away?
This must be some kind of joke...
And it isn't funny!
I can't hold it in any longer!
Knuckle's rampage was halted
by the first tap from Meleoron.
Seriously?! It's only been ten seconds!
But that just might have saved me.
Meleoron wasn't trying to help Knuckle.
He, too, had reached his limit.
Crap!
Uh-oh.
He barely scratched me, but it
was enough damage
to offset the interest and
my full-strength attack.
Shoot is risking his life out there,
while I'm standing here unhurt,
and making stupid mistakes!
Youpi felt no sensation of scratching anything,
nor did he notice APR's declaration
of returned interest.
Damn!
He couldn't hear Knuckle's scream, either.
Calm down, you fool...
You're gonna ruin everything.
Here's the distance where we want to stay...
Not close enough for him to find us,
but close enough to get in fast.
He'll notice APR for a second,
but that's no problem.
Shoot's fighting hard,
so go ahead and catch your breath, Meleoron.
God's Accomplice...
Undo.
What is this thing?
When did it show up?
No, it can't be that I didn't notice it.
It just suddenly appeared.
Was I hit by an attack?
No, I wasn't.
A delayed effect?
So it must have been then!
Does that mean the condition
was met during the fight?
What is this number?
Is it a countdown? A bomb?
No, the number isn't going up or down.
This is too much of a pain!
I only need to destroy the source!
Something's coming.
Despite his overwhelming power,
one reason Youpi was unable to defeat Shoot
was the evident difference in
skill level between them.
It's fast... I can't get away!
One skewered chunk of meat coming up!
He hit himself to accelerate.
Very well...
That was close.
The reaction to the attack told Youpi
that he could win at any moment.
Youpi wasn't the kind of fighter to rely on strategy,
so this spurred him on.
Youpi's analysis was on the mark.
It was true that Youpi was
increasingly likely to win this fight.
If he made any mistake, it was not realizing
that Shoot was fine with this fact.
I can keep going...
I...
can still fly.
I'm not done...
However, quietly and surely...
Shoot was reaching his limit.
Hey, Youpi!
Over here, fool!
Knuckle!
I'm telling him that there's one
more enemy to worry about?
That's fine.
That will serve to distract Youpi,
and it will save Shoot.
Bring it!
After calming down and regaining composure,
Knuckle decided to show himself.
Next time: Duty x And x Question.
Huh? Where are you, Gon?
Over here.
Gon! Wait, you disappeared again!
Perfect Plan... Undo!
I'm always by your side.
﻿Hey, Youpi!
I'm over here, fool!
I'm telling him that there's one
more enemy to worry about?
That's fine.
That will serve to distract Youpi,
and it will save Shoot.
Duty x And x Question
"Hagya-sama."
Ikalgo didn't realize that the name
he had spoken with full confidence
had aroused Welfin and Brovada's suspicions,
as he headed beneath the palace
to search for Palm.
Satellite Dragonflies!
Ikalgo knew Palm only through the
information he had been given.
However, he was already firm in his resolve
that he wouldn't leave the palace without finding her.
I'm gonna rescue her.
Palm is a friend of a friend.
That makes her a friend...
My friend!
Palm was risking her life.
That fact alone had earned Ikalgo's respect.
I'm not doing this out of duty or obligation.
I want to help her...
Because I decided I would help her!
The elevator leading underground
was equipped with a security camera and a scale.
After arriving underground,
it would confirm that there was nothing inside
before automatically returning to the surface.
Any number of people could descend at once,
but only one could ascend at a time.
And a pass code had to be entered.
The eight-digit code varied per person,
and could be used to identify
who had used the elevator.
If the user's height and weight
do not match the data
on record from the time the code
was assigned, a warning sounded,
and the elevator became a prison.
On the first entry of an incorrect code,
a warning sounded, and the doors locked.
Should an incorrect code be entered three times, security was alerted,
the elevator filled with sleeping gas,
and the violator was captured and tortured.
In other words, a third error meant death.
Both the violator and the code's
original owner would be killed,
making one's code as valuable as one's own life.
And the only code holders
able to use the elevator without
any such restriction
were Bizeff and Marcos.
That was because the elevator
was a more convenient means
of smuggling in various things, including humans,
than the cargo entrance,
which was watched by soldiers.
What is this smell?!
Has Flutter been living in the morgue?
I can also smell Bro, since he was
the last one in here before me.
Damn, there's something else, very faint...
The stench of Flutter's decomposing body served
to dull Welfin's sense of smell.
Since Bro followed Flutter underground,
he must have also noticed that Flutter
used the name "Hagya-sama."
Or is Brovada conspiring with him?
When I was watching the intruder,
was Bro watching me from behind?
If he was, and if he's working with the intruder,
then he must have seen that
I noticed Flutter's odd behavior...
So, he went down first...
In order to ambush me!
Damn, this is my chance!
Flutter was clearly acting suspiciously.
If I can pass him off him as the
bomb threat's perpetrator,
Bizeff will be indebted to me!
Bizeff!
Where's Bizeff?
This is bad...
If he dies during the attack,
my plans will be ruined!
Forget Flutter... First, I need to find Bizeff!
Yo.
Grandpa...
He's changed.
My job here is done.
I know nothing beyond the mission I received.
I'll let you draw your own conclusions
about what's happening inside.
Inside?
Swallowing the words he wanted to say,
Zeno disappeared into the darkness.
Meanwhile, near the wrecked central stairway,
Knuckle has revealed himself, a move
that was not part of the original plan.
Meleoron and Shoot
could only hold their breaths.
Bring it!
Bring it!
I see... Then this is yours.
It's time.
Adding interest.
The number increased?
My attacks won't work?
What is this thing?
Don't you run!
Answer me!
What is this thing?!
I ain't gonna tell you, fool!
If you wanna know, catch me first!
Knuckle's planning to fight Youpi alone...
I can't weave through those
blades of death to get to him!
In that case, I'll walk at a pace
that's neither fast nor slow,
to conserve as much oxygen as possible!
I must not lose consciousness...
If I pass out,
Hotel Rafflesia will stop...
Every little bit of damage counts...
I can still fight...
I can still...
I can't... I just can't say it!
I can't tell Shoot to keep fighting!
Right now, my job...
isn't to help Shoot!
It's to use my power to help the others,
so they can complete their
missions as fast as possible!
You have to survive, Shoot!
Don't die!
No one's here.
Stay calm...
Look around carefully.
If I'm caught, I can still pretend
to be on their side.
However...
That might not work, depending on who I run into.
Perfect Plan... Undo!
Okay!
Activate!
That's Morel's Smoky Jail.
Which means...
Morel and Pouf are dueling it out in the throne
room, with no possibility of interruption!
That only leaves...
Gon and Killua!
Where are they? Where are Gon and Killua?
Which way did they go?
Welfin?!
Crap!
He's tough to deal with...
He's the most skeptical of the Squadron Leaders!
Once he suspects you, he won't
trust you again until you're dead!
I'm already running out of breath... Do I run?
Which way do I go?
What if he goes the same way?
Do I wait for him to leave?
Can I hold my breath that much longer?
No... I can't hold it!
I'm at my limit!
I'll have to exhale and inhale in one swift act!
Perfect Plan, undo!
Now inhale...
Activate!
For a second, I sensed something.
The enemy?
Welfin's power reflected his very nature,
channeling his suspicion into an effective weapon.
Egg Man
Missile Man
Missile Man!
If anyone's hiding behind the building,
surrender and show yourself by
the time I count down from three!
If you don't, I'll attack!
Three!
Two!
One!
Fire!
No one's there... Did I imagine it?
To use Missile Man, Welfin identifies his target
and loads ammo in the form
of questions or commands.
If someone answers falsely or disobeys,
the attack is launched.
By the time Welfin noticed a presence,
Meleoron had already moved.
Had Meleoron stayed in the same place,
his attack would have succeeded,
despite his inability to detect his target.
Finding nothing fitting the target's
description, the attack failed.
Once fired, Missile Man will
pursue its target until it hits.
No one can survive the impact.
However, Welfin understood that
his ability wasn't omnipotent.
His power was nothing more than a tool.
Welfin was even skeptical of his own power.
He sought to become the king behind the scenes,
because being the real king would mean
he'd have too much to be suspicious of.
It was my imagination?
No, wait...
I smell odorless deodorant...
You can't fool my nose.
Someone was here! I know it!
Since I could only sense them for a moment,
they must be very skilled.
The use of deodorant confirms
that they're aware of my nose.
This confirms that there are traitors among us!
There are others besides Flutter?
The answer is probably yes!
And it's someone I know...
That's why they're hiding their scent.
Who is it?
They don't want to fight me?
Because they can take me out at any time?
Do I...
Do I...
Do I really
want to stay on the Chimera Ants' side?
Should I really be
searching for Bizeff now?
As Welfin began to doubt his own objectives...
Gon and Killua had finally found Neferpitou,
their target for avenging Kite.
Next time: Revenge x And x Recovery.
Meleoron!
Ikalgo.
Knuckle!
Shoot.
Morel-san!
Knov.
Palm!
Gon.
Killua...
No matter what happens, always have faith.
﻿The Hunters have entered the palace in
order to defeat the Chimera Ant King.
My attacks don't work?
What is this thing?
Don't you run!
Answer me!
What is this thing?!
I ain't gonna tell you, fool!
If you wanna know, catch me first!
To save the injured Shoot,
Knuckle taunted Youpi to draw his attention.
Knuckle's planning to fight Youpi alone...
I can't weave through those
blades of death to get to him!
In that case...
I must not lose consciousness...
If I pass out,
Hotel Rafflesia will stop...
Every little bit of damage counts...
I can still fight...
I can still...
Right now, my job...
isn't to help Shoot!
It's to use my power to help the others,
so they can complete their
missions as fast as possible!
Though it broke his heart,
Meleoron had to leave the two Hunters
and follow Gon and Killua instead,
in order to fulfill his mission.
Meanwhile, Ikalgo proceeded further into
the depths of the palace to rescue Palm.
Satellite Dragonflies!
I'm gonna rescue her.
Palm is a friend of a friend.
That makes her a friend...
My friend!
As Morel, the first Hunter
to reach the throne room,
waited to continue his battle with Pouf,
who remained in his cocoon,
Netero and the King were leaving the palace,
and Gon and Killua had finally located Neferpitou,
their target for avenging Kite.
Revenge x And x Recovery
Do you
remember me?
I'm Gon Freecss!
I came here
to get Kite back from you!
Pitou didn't hear a single word Gon said.
The only thing on Pitou's mind was
surviving the current threat
while carrying out the King's order.
Every cell in Pitou's body was focused on that task.
I must protect Komugi...
At any cost!
Something's not right.
Watching from a short distance, Killua
noticed that something was strange.
Why isn't the enemy preparing for
battle when we're right here?
I can't sense any aura at all...
Pitou might as well be completely
naked... Utterly defenseless.
Does Pitou think it can win without aura?
No, that isn't possible.
The aura coming from Gon now
doesn't even compare to his usual.
Even Pitou can't fight that without using Nen.
Is it because of where we are?
Does Pitou believe that, at this distance,
there'll be time to activate Nen if we do attack?
That's possible.
However, for some reason...
That doesn't seem to be it.
It almost looks like...
That's it.
It looks like...
a mother
using its own body to guard something weaker.
That's ridiculous.
Pitou isn't someone who's capable of that!
But then, why did Grandpa...
I'll let you draw your own conclusions
about what's happening inside.
...say something that cryptic?
While Killua was fighting his natural instincts,
the girl lying before them brought back
images of a broken Kite to Gon's mind.
Get away from her.
I'm telling you to take that
monster and get away from her.
And then, fight me!
Fight me, so I can get Kite back!
The act of placing both palms face-up
to display one's lack of malice
was a gesture Killua recognized...
Please
wait.
What the hell?!
What am I supposed to wait for?
Get up! We're going outside!
Pitou's unexpected lack of resistance
left Gon without a target for his rage.
Meanwhile, Killua was close to fully
understanding the current situation.
It was...
I know nothing beyond the mission I received.
He was saying something
unexpected happened!
Grandpa knew nothing when
he brought the dragon down.
Grandpa's mission was probably
to use Dragon Dive and Dragon Head to
separate the King and Royal Guard.
But he didn't know that she was here, too.
Wait, this woman must be
the third party that none of us knew about!
And she's most likely
the reason the King hurt himself.
Why would the King do something
so out of character?
Because she is someone
who's special to the King.
Pitou isn't taking her apart.
Pitou is healing her at the King's command!
Pitou isn't only prevented from using
En when healing someone.
All aura must be focused on
healing ability when using it.
However, Killua knew that this
information would only have
a negative effect on Gon.
What do I do?
What do I tell him?
Go—
I'll do anything!
I'll do anything you say!
So please wait.
I...
must save this person!
Save...
Save what?
"Anything"?
When you say "anything"...
Killua...
I'm asking the questions.
What is it that you must save?
Amidst the extreme tension,
the answer Pitou chose to give was...
This person is someone...
Someone who's important
to someone important to me.
...the truth.
She is the reason the King is who he is.
If she dies, the King will cease to be who he is.
She's that important.
So...
All I care about is saving her!
Once she's healed, I'll do anything you want.
So please wait!
You want to save her?
You must save her?
Save her?
How dare you say that...
How dare you?!
Damn it!
The hell if...
The hell if I'll listen to you!
Gon, hold on!
It's likely that we were
the ones that injured her.
It was probably Grandpa's Dragon Dive.
And?
Pitou is probably telling the
truth about healing her.
So?
Let's wait until it's done.
"Likely"?
"Probably"?
You want me to wait because
of "likely" and "probably"?
And after we wait, it's likely that this thing
will do what I want?
Likely? Probably?
Seriously?!
That's crap!
That's just crap!
Is something wrong with you?!
You want... You want me to trust this thing?!
I can't do that!
If you want, you may also have my right arm...
If that isn't enough,
you can take both legs...
If you're worried I'll change my mind
after the healing finishes,
you can break any part of my body
that isn't required to heal her.
Please let me save her!
That isn't fair...
That isn't fair, damn it!
Why are you helping her,
after everything you did to Kite?!
Gon!
Why?!
Why?!
To hell with that.
First comes—
Gon, if you kill Pitou,
we'll never get Kite back.
You have it easy, Killua.
You're perfectly calm.
Since it means nothing to you...
I'm only saying this because
you're out of control.
Did you forget the first thing
you said when we came here?
We're here to get Kite back!
Pull it together!
Yeah.
I'm okay now.
How long?
How long do I have to wait?
To completely heal her
will take three to four hours.
No, I can't wait that long.
If I have an hour,
I can heal her most critical injuries.
Please give me that.
In one hour, you're coming with
me to Peijing, to heal Kite.
Can you promise me that?
I swear to keep that promise!
I'll wait right here for one hour.
Next time: Insult x And x Payback.
I can't think of anything right now...
Killua, insult me back!
I... feel better now.
﻿Why?!
You have it easy, Killua.
You're perfectly calm.
Since it means nothing to you...
Gon's cry had guided
Meleoron to the two boys.
Insult x And x Payback
I'm going to have to refuse.
Right now, I'm not in the mood.
Come on, don't say that.
Just think of it as bad luck that I found you!
Let me test my new technique on you.
That hurts, man...
You don't have to give me such a dirty look.
The one I really want to fight
is someone else, you know.
That guy with sunglasses,
carrying the big pipe.
Aren't you with him?
Then, why don't you go and find him?
I know where he is.
But I can't get to him.
He controls smoke, and he's hidden
himself behind a smokescreen.
And I can't get through.
I climbed up to the roof, to see
if I could get in from above...
And I happened to spot you.
So I'm supposed to be the warm-up
before your main fight?
Bingo!
I've had it for today...
Will you listen to what I have to say?
For the first time since taking
over the family business,
I may have killed someone who wasn't my target.
Dude, my technique is awesome!
Don't be too shocked when you see it.
Well, you'll still be shocked in the end...
You're a self-centered fellow.
Doesn't look like I'll be able to
persuade you to let me go.
Bingo and bingo!
You should watch your back.
What an old trick!
I won't fall for that!
Your buddy told me to keep
my eyes on my opponeâ€”
Well, the result would have
been the same either way.
Should I have spared him?
Not necessary.
How's Killua doing?
Hmm? He's matured.
And I believe that he's removed Illumi's needle.
I see.
Oh, that's right...
I had a rare experience today.
My time was compressed!
I must remember to ignore
half of everything you say.
Okay, we should be safe here.
Explain what's going on.
God's Accomplice... Undo!
Shoot's out of the battle,
and Knuckle is fighting Youpi alone.
I need your help...
Knuckle's going to keep running,
to try and buy time.
He's crazy!
Okay, what's the minimum length of time
you can maintain God's Accomplice?
The first time, I was so nervous, I failed
and had to tap out after ten seconds.
But I've regained my cool.
If I don't move, I can hold my
breath for at least a minute!
That's plenty of time.
I just need one chance.
Approximately three minutes
before Killua raised his finger...
Knuckle was airborne.
In Knuckle's own opinion, his strongest
point was his ability to run away.
Once, to help his friends escape,
he knocked out a cop,
and eluded four patrol cars and dozens
of police for a full day and night, on foot.
The day he finally escaped was the day
he graduated from grade school.
His stamina when maintaining top speed
far exceeds that of a cheetah.
To save Shoot, Knuckle had chosen
to reveal himself and use an out-boxing
strategy against Youpi.
For the most part, it was the right choice.
He stopped chasing me?
If there was one thing he miscalculated,
it was his opponent's intentions.
Shoot's in trouble! Crap!
Shoot and Knuckle considered
Youpi a high-priority target.
But Youpi wasn't as focused on them.
As a Royal Guard, protecting the
King was his mission.
His focus was on keeping enemies from the King.
Youpi still believed the King
to be in the throne room.
And since guarding the stairway
was his assignment,
he was convinced that Pitou and
Pouf were protecting the King.
So his main priority was to keep enemies
away from the throne room.
Since he didn't know how
many enemies there were,
the nature of his opponent's
ability took second priority.
As did any enemies running or dying.
They did not warrant his concern.
Hey! Pitou!
Shoot!
Shoot was still alive.
Shoot...
Given their positions, when Youpi turned back,
he must have spotted Shoot.
Then we aren't even worth...
finishing off?
Youpi didn't care if Shoot lived or died.
After having fought him with all they had,
the pair had never felt so humiliated.
Are Shoot
and I
no more than flies?!
Fine, then!
You're gonna regret this!
In a few more minutes,
this fly will send you flying!
Pitou! Pouf!
Are you there?
The boss used Smoky Jail on the throne room.
That means he and Pouf are alone inside.
The King isn't in the throne room!
Say something! Can't you hear me?
Hey!
You fool...
You're free to defend an empty throne room!
I'll take Shoot, and watch from a safe distance.
Damn it...
By the time Knuckle realized his mistake,
he had already made another.
Shoot and Youpi must have seen one another.
Shoot must have been prepared
to die at that moment.
That's the kind of fight we came for.
But he ignored Shoot...
When Knuckle pictured the
expression on Youpi's face
after he'd glanced at the bloody Shoot
and headed up to the third floor,
Knuckle realized his new mistake.
Damn it.
Damn it...
Am I supposed to ignore the fact
that my buddy's been humiliated?
For what reason?
For the world?
For humanity?
And if our mission succeeds,
I just shake Shoot's hand and say,
"We did it"?
Pat each other's shoulders and laugh?
Even though he was humiliated?
I can't do that!
That isn't right...
C-Come on...
Oh, sorry.
And while I'm apologizing, I need
you to wait here a little longer!
I need to punch that guy in the face...
And I'll throw another punch for you!
It's my job to stay calm and stop Knuckle...
"Have you lost your mind?
Don't go.
Just keep your mouth shut, and buy more time."
That is my...
Do it, Knuckle!
Damn it!
That bastard...
He...
He...
looked at me like I was trash!
Give that bastard an extra punch for me...
Yeah, I got it!
Sorry, master...
We're both fools.
There's something more important
than the world right now!
Knuckle's new mistake
was a misjudgment of his priorities.
My attacks aren't having any
effect on this smoke...
Your Majesty!
Pitou! Pouf!
Are you there? Hey!
Is that Youpi?
Were they both defeated?
I hope the old man's doing okay...
Why isn't Pouf responding?
Something's wrong.
Why is he staying inside his cocoon?
I would have expected him to be in
more of a hurry to get to the King.
Could we have made...
some kind of mistake about the Royal Guard?
Is our operation actually working?
Don't think about it!
I'm here to fulfill my mission!
Doubt, worry, impatience...
Negative emotions are growing,
but his resolve has not faltered.
Just as I would expect from a strong fighter.
I'm impressed.
However, that will be the constraint
that weakens your decision-making.
Damn...
Why is Pitou's En gone?
Have the King, Pitou, and Pouf all vanished?
Leaving me behind?
What happened?
What's going on?
It's time.
Adding interest.
Shut up!
The black fog on my shoulder won't go away.
And the number on this thing keeps increasing.
I have to find the King!
Damn, I should have killed the fly downstairs.
That might have gotten rid of this fog.
But I have to find the King!
What's going on?!
I'm getting annoyed!
Yo.
What the hell is wrong with all of you?!
And with that shout, Youpi transformed.
It was drastic enough to make Knuckle,
who thought he had come prepared,
instantly switch from an offensive
stance to an evasive one.
This manifestation of evil
clearly meant only to destroy.
Hang on!
Did you...
hit him?
Eh?
Did you hit him...
for me?
Not yet, damn it!
I'll hit him hard, so hold on!
But we have to run, so we don't die first!
For the first time in his life,
Youpi had endured an excessive amount of stress.
This had made it apparent that
his power was not meant for guarding the King.
Rather, he realized that his violent rage
could fuel a rapid increase in the
mass of both his body and his aura.
The destruction brought him great pleasure,
after which his body rapidly shrank,
and he felt a strong sense of loss.
Knuckle's superior experience helped him
understand what had happened to Youpi.
We can win.
That was a powerful blast.
I doubt it'll be easy to goad him
into doing that on purpose,
and make it out unharmed.
But the return for taking that risk
will be enormous.
I make him mad, so he blows up.
The perfect time to hit him
would be when he's charging up.
And the aura required to fuel his explosion
will cause him to go bankrupt sooner.
The plan Knuckle formed on the spot
was almost flawless for dealing
with the berserk Youpi.
However, Youpi's true worth only
became clear after the explosion.
As Youpi transitioned between
lingering pleasure and despondency,
this selfish ability that could be
called the dregs of his ego
was focused solely on how he could use
this power for the King's sake.
Selflessness...
His Ant instincts and Magical Beast mentality
continued to function calmly even after
the discovery of his burst of emotion.
My contribution to the King will be
how well I can control this ability
without letting my emotions take over.
In other words,
I must use it to destroy the intruders.
Now that Youpi had learned how
to be both enraged and composed,
the risk for Knuckle was overly great.
Approximately three minutes have
passed since the mission began.
The intentions of all involved
are beginning to come together.
Next time: A x False x Rage.
Yeah, screw you!
Sorry, Killua...
I won't forgive you.
Here's a chocolate robot.
Gon!
﻿Do it, Knuckle!
Damn it!
That bastard...
He...
He...
looked at me like I was trash!
Give that bastard an extra punch for me...
Yeah, I got it!
Sorry, master...
We're both fools.
There's something more important
than the world right now!
A x False x Rage
Though the central tower's third floor
escaped destruction, having been
cushioned by Morel's Smoky Jail,
it had been blown slightly to
the left of its original position,
barely keeping the building's appearance intact
while maintaining a precarious balance.
Nearby, in the middle of the
central tower's lower portion,
which had been reduced to rubble
resembling an ancient gladiator arena...
I am a foolish servant of the King,
letting my rage consume me as I hunt my prey.
That's how I should approach it.
That's the impression I should give them.
Where are you hiding, little rats?
Come out here, so I can squash you!
I know he'll show himself again...
To exploit the opening just before I explode.
It's time.
Adding inte—
Shut up!
While Youpi was allowing a
false rage to consume him,
putting on a show of shouting
in order to draw out Knuckle...
No matter what happens outside,
my goal is to pin this guy here.
That's all I need to do!
Approximately one hundred trillion microorganisms,
tiny enough to pass between particles of smoke,
maintained just enough distance
as to go unnoticed by Morel
as, slowly but surely, Pouf carried out
his escape from Smoky Jail.
Beneath the northern section of the palace
Palace
Border Guard Area F
was a large area, with warehouses laid
out in the shape of a dragonfly.
Cultural Assets/National Treasures Area B        Weapons/Ammunition Area A
Supreme Leader's Private Shelter Area E
Emergency Rations/Supplies Area D    Supreme Leader's Personal Effects Area C
Area D, located on one of the wing's tips,
was where Bizeff had created a private zone
with his warehouse for hiding women.
Having learned the warehouse's
location from Marcos,
Ikalgo was making his way there by truck
via a direct, five-kilometer road.
By the time Ikalgo had reached
the crossroads that led to Areas A and B,
his Satellite Dragonflies had already
arrived at the warehouse.
The door's open...
This is a good sign.
Palm put Bizeff to sleep
and headed for the palace.
When he awoke, Bizeff forgot to lock
the door in his rush to follow her.
That's the likely explanation.
Brovada's in the border guard area?
This meant that Ikalgo
had no choice but to face Brovada.
Brovada doesn't trust me.
Why? Did I make some kind of mistake?
Stay calm...
Stay calm and figure out what he
knows and what he doesn't,
in order to stay alive!
What happened during our encounter
that aroused his suspicion?
Was there something unnatural
about my imitation of Flutter?
I suppose it would be strange for Hagya
to order me to go underground.
But since they didn't stop me on the spot,
my mistake must not have been fatal.
Rather, something aroused an inkling
of doubt in the back of Brovada's mind.
And Brovada's down here because he
wants to confirm those doubts!
Was it small enough that I can explain?
Or was it big enough that he
only wants final verification?
No room for optimism.
I should assume it was a big mistake.
Is anyone here?
I am a messenger from the secretary!
Depending on the response...
No, I have to assume
that if he has a chance, he'll attack...
Or he'll kill me!
I am a messenger from the secretary!
The secretary ordered me to come here!
Thinker Bell!
If you're here, you must come with me at once!
Messengers were never sent to Bizeff's warehouse.
This was meant to reassure
Palm that he was an ally.
Why didn't you respond?
Where's everyone else?
I d-don't know anything about
what's happening outside...
I'm not allowed to talk to anyone
other than the secretary.
She had assumed
that this was a test of loyalty by the secretary.
The other women thought the same thing.
Each room had a phone exclusively
for communication with Bizeff,
so it was illogical for him to send
a messenger, hence their suspicion.
They believed that a visit from a stranger
must be a test to see if they could
stay calm and follow orders
under unusual circumstances,
so they refused to speak to Ikalgo.
However, that worked in Ikalgo's favor.
Is this the place?
The women had a much higher chance
of surviving if they stayed here.
Ikalgo didn't have the time to worry about
keeping them alive, much less protecting them.
There's writing in Nen!
The characters, formed by aura,
could only be seen when using Gyo.
It was less likely that Bizeff
would find a message that wasn't
on paper or some other device.
"Heading to the palace.
If I don't make contact before the mission,
assume I am dead."
Ikalgo had expected this.
But he still felt as much anguish as
if he had lost part of his own body.
Palm...
If Palm is dead or assumed to be dead,
use your Satellite Dragonflies and
telepathy to support the team.
Got it.
Pretend that you're reporting
to your Squadron Leader,
when you're actually reporting to Meleoron.
So you want me to feed the enemy lies,
to throw them off?
Yes. It's a crucial task.
I'm counting on you.
That will only be possible
if they don't know Meleoron is here,
or that I've switched sides.
Which means that, since he
is already suspicious of me,
I must eliminate Brovada!
Yo, did you finish your mission from Hagya?
Yeah... I did.
Hagya, huh?
Doesn't he get mad when we call him that?
Okay, the fake is dead.
Empty?
Whatever, I'll just ask Hagya.
The suspect is now dead!
Once Brovada reports that to the other Ants,
I can move around freely.
Still, I never heard anything about
Hagya changing his name!
What's he called now?
It's true that I really knew
nothing of his new name...
But will they believe that?
I must think of a reason they'll accept
if I encounter any of them.
No, that won't work!
Brovada opened fire without warning!
That shows they think anyone who doesn't
know Hagya's new name is an enemy.
If they find me, there'll be a battle!
I have to go back up there expecting that!
Please enter your code number.
The elevator isn't ascending!
Don't tell me that he came
down here without knowing
about the passcode system.
This is my chance!
I have two options to pick from!
Show yourself!
It's nearly been five minutes since
Chapter 7 Bankruptcy activated.
Which means the Nen I've
loaned him is nearing 7,000.
Is that enough to guarantee that he won't
pay off the full balance with one hit?
I just...
I just have to avoid a direct hit.
The worst possible scenario
would be that I'm hit
by an attack that wipes out Chapter 7
Bankruptcy, and also deals damage to me.
If that's gonna happen,
I'm better off buying time,
waiting for him to go bust.
But that means I'll have to wait
for at least ten minutes.
Shoot... Shoot won't last that long!
I have to make him explode once more.
Or else we'll run out of time!
Before the battle ends, Shoot will die!
You look happy, monster!
He fell for my trap, for my false rage.
I've been looking for you, cockroach.
Make this damn fly that's
following me around shut up!
Damn Fly
Every time it squeaks,
I'm reminded of your annoying face!
Okay, I'm ready to explode at any time.
But I'll be faking it...
It's time.
Adding interest.
Just shut up!
Right before I explode, I pause for a moment.
He'll try to attack during that opening.
But if I stay calm when my rage takes over,
I can control my growth.
Get this thing off me right now...
Or I'll kill you!
I'll blow every last one of you
to smithereens, you scum!
When he tries to take advantage of
the opening I give him, he'll be open.
And I'll take advantage of that.
That won't happen, you giant lump.
You're gonna die on your knees right here.
The next one...
The next tick of the interest will be the gong.
I'll show you who the cockroach is here.
It's time.
Adding interest.
This will work.
I have time to land one... No, two hits!
I have time to punch him in the face,
and get out of the way before the explosion!
Take this, pig!
This one's for Shoot!
And the next one's also for Shoot!
Is something wrong with me?
I was never that close to him...
Actually, to be honest, I didn't really like him.
I don't even know when he
climbed to the rank of "friend"...
So why am I this desperate to avenge him?
It's not even "vengeance," since he's not dead...
Well, I guess a lot of it is that
we've faced death together...
Anyone who's risked their
life with you is a friend.
But this bastard insulted Shoot's resolve!
He ignored someone who entered
a fight with him expecting to die?
Has he no sympathy as a warrior?
Damn Ant!
I'm getting more and more pissed off!
I'll give him a third punch for myself!
Wow... I'm amazing myself!
I don't think my mind has ever thought this fast!
And I haven't finished throwing my punch?
Wait...
Is this what they mean?
Time's almost frozen.
Everything slows down...
right before you die?
He stopped the explosion!
He got me!
He was actually keeping his cool...
I can't stop!
Sorry, Shoot...
I screwed up!
The interest won't be enough to pay for this.
It's over...
Shoot...
Boss...
Everyone...
Everything is...
up to you.
Thunderbolt!
Lightning?
He's completely paralyzed...
This is my chance!
If you're not all big, I can knock you silly!
I did it! I did it! I did it!
I'm done! I can't do any more!
Crap, I almost died!
I could see the pearly gates...
My first task is to get Shoot to a hospital.
I hit him eight times!
What just happened?
I'm sure he fell for my trap.
What happened?
That's obvious.
I didn't notice there was an attack
coming from a different direction...
Is that possible?
That I didn't notice a bolt of lightning that massive
until it was right over me?
The same thing happened before.
Before I even realized it,
this little nuisance was on me.
There were no signs at all.
I saw him back at the staircase...
Did he do it?
Sorry, but what's about to happen is
just me blowing off some steam.
Next time: Strong x Or x Weak.
Octopus or Ikalgo? Which do you go with?
Ika-tta say I'd go with Ikalgo.
Ikan agree with that!
﻿I saw him back at the staircase...
Did he do it?
Sorry, but what's about to happen is
just me blowing off some steam.
Strong x Or x Weak
He disappeared?
Godspeed.
The difference in initial action
speed was so overwhelming
that Youpi had no time to
make a sound or transform.
Killua's Godspeed placed an
electrical burden upon his own body,
making it possible for his body to
perform at a level far beyond
what should have been possible.
Killua had divided this power
into two different abilities:
Speed of Lightning, which allowed
him to control his body at will,
Speed of Lightning
and Whirlwind, which allowed his body
to react automatically to his opponent.
Whirlwind
In a previous fight, he'd used the
latter to stop his opponent's dart.
A preprogrammed attack is triggered in response
to vibrations in aura that
indicate the opponent's hostility.
The attack bypasses commands from his brain,
unleashing attacks that transcend his
own limits by relying on reflexes alone,
allowing him to easily surpass
his opponent's physical speed.
What's going on here?
All of these guys have less than
ten percent of my raw power.
This makes no sense...
I can't do a thing against him.
Whirlwind!
Profound...
This "aura" stuff is intense...
This is getting interesting.
Before my explosion, I never would
have enjoyed fighting an uphill battle.
Youpi's change in heart would lead him
to make an unbelievable choice,
but this would not happen until later.
Crap!
I used it all up!
Hold it!
You're not getting away!
You're seeing this through with me...
Until you die!
He disappeared?
Again.
He vanished, as though he were
never here to begin with.
That's it...
At least one of them must have the ability
to make people appear and disappear at will.
Huh?
Please enter your passcode.
Damn, I didn't get a code.
Your passcode and name do not match.
Please reenter your passcode.
A second input error will result in your restraint.
He came down here without a passcode?
Okay... Guess I'll have to step out.
The door has been locked.
Please enter your passcode.
This is my chance!
I have two options.
The elevator will fill with
sleeping gas eventually.
Once he's asleep, I have to decide.
One, I leave Brovada in the elevator,
Monitor Room
and head for the surface through the cargo entrance.
This way, when he wakes up,
he'll still be stuck in the elevator.
But there's a high risk that someone above
will notice that the elevator isn't coming up.
Two, I move Brovada somewhere
else while he's asleep.
There are plenty of trucks parked around.
And the warehouse doors require a
passcode to open from the inside.
When he wakes up, Brovada won't
be able to open them.
And if I use the cargo entrance
to return to the surface,
the risk that I'll encounter enemies will
be much lower than if I take the elevator.
No! That won't work!
I have to kill Brovada while he's asleep!
That's the safest option!
Then, I have to take control of Brovada's corpse,
and use it to take out other Squadron Leaders.
That's the least it'll take!
I'll stick the barrel of my gun through
the gap in his armor and open fire.
Ikalgo had the ability to control dead bodies,
but he had never killed anyone
with his own hands before.
Enter your passcode at once.
If a passcode is not entered
within thirty seconds,
the restraining process will begin.
The monitor room in the border guard area...
There should be a monitor
for the elevator camera,
and a button to open the doors!
Well, I'm outside now,
but I had to destroy the elevator...
Is there another exit?
I was naïve...
I didn't expect him to shoot the door.
What now?
Do I wait for him to lower his guard,
then sneak out the cargo entrance?
Or do I wait for him to leave?
Either way, if he goes back to the surface...
That's not good enough!
I'm being naïve!
If he returns to the surface,
and tells the others that Flutter's dead,
I'll be able to move around freely!
Am I an idiot?
If I allow an enemy to return to the surface,
I'm putting everyone else in more danger.
This one's tough.
I can't let him go back up...
If I can't stop him, I've failed my friends!
Yes, this way!
I'm gonna trap you.
A little farther...
Wait until he's a little farther from it...
Now!
So there was someone besides Flutter...
Looks like you were trying to lure me in there...
Too bad for you.
If only one path remains, it's too good
to be true. Anyone would be suspicious.
Well, now I know about you.
And I bet you're hiding in the
monitor room to watch me, chicken!
Damn...
I could have completely
trapped him in that hallway...
But there's no way out from where he is now.
He's still trapped.
Sleeping gas will eventually
fill the room, and he'll...
Crap! He isn't trapped!
There's a way out!
I should get out of here...
That's probably sleeping gas.
I have to do something before he realizes.
I know...
The armored vehicles in the garage.
With those, I could at least lock him in.
But then I'll have no way to get
back to the surface, either!
Think...
Is there anything I can use here?
Come up with the best possible plan, fast!
I guess I have to blow through this shutter...
How annoying!
I have to do this!
Damn! All that firing, and I
barely scorched the surface?
Guess I'll need to think of something else...
I know!
You can operate the shutters
from the monitor room,
Monitor Room
so I can go there to open the shutters.
Nice idea!
Wait,
I have to go through the shutters
to reach the monitor room.
Damn, so I have to get through these
shutters to return to the surface?
Wait...
There might be a way
to escape without busting down the shutters.
The shutter's opening?
An armored vehicle?
That's something a chicken would use.
But the shutter behind it is still shut.
The door to the monitor room is beyond that shutter.
Which means that...
First,
he closed the front shutter and
parked the vehicle there.
Then he returned to the monitor room,
and started raising the front shutter
and lowering the back one,
before racing back to the vehicle?
Doesn't that mean he's also trapped?
He closed off his only escape
route, just to finish me off?
Heh... Yeah, right.
So there's more than one...
The other's watching in the monitor room.
Pisses me off!
Watch this, you peeping tom...
I'm gonna drag your buddy
out of the armored vehicle
and rip him to shreds!
I'm the only one here.
I have to do something...
By myself!
That's tough armor!
I did it!
Crap! He blocked the elevator!
I could have blown a hole in the
ceiling, and climbed up the wire!
I've blocked his escape route.
First hurdle cleared!
You have guts to show yourself...
I'm gonna riddle you with bullets!
Smoke?
Did he kill himself?
Miss his chance to escape?
Either way, there's no way to move this thing!
There's only a few centimeters of space.
The elevator's completely blocked!
Hey! Your friend's gonna burn to death!
If you act now, I'm willing to spare you!
Open the damned shutter!
You hear me?
Being an octopus, I only need a few
centimeters to squeeze through.
Second hurdle cleared.
Hey!
Open the shutter!
Now, I just have to wait for the
sleeping gas to fill the room.
I can hold my breath,
but I don't want to waste time.
Wait for the right timing!
Third hurdle cleared.
Be patient.
Nice and slow.
This is the final hurdle.
I just have to pull the trigger, and I'm done.
Fire! This is the best option!
I'll be safest if I control his body
and return to the surface!
Which means I have to kill him...
I'm the only one here.
There's no one else to help me!
I h-have to...
kill him!
I can't do it!
I'm...
I'm...
just a coward!
While Ikalgo was lamenting his weakness...
Within the shifted central tower,
as Morel faced off against Pouf's cocoon,
he was battling doubts of his own, as well.
Hold on.
What if...
Pitou! Pouf!
Are you there?
Hey!
What if it isn't that he chose
not to respond to Youpi,
but that he wasn't able to respond?
Within the cocoon should be
nothing but a goopy mess.
He shouldn't be a completely formed creature yet.
If he's utterly defenseless
while he changes forms,
this is the time to attack.
Would he really make such a literally
fatal mistake in this situation?
It's not possible!
This must be a trap. It's guaranteed to be a trap.
But the question is whether the
trap activates when I attack,
or if it's already been activated,
before I've even attacked.
Which is it?
You have doubts because you
are good at what you do.
However, that is all there is to it.
Attack? Don't attack?
What do I do?
Next time: Fake x And x Real.
Hey... If not now, when?
Not yet!
You're a fake. You aren't Killua.
﻿No way...
Where did he go, in that condition?!
Shoot...
Fake X And X Real
You intend to fight?
You will abandon your original plan, and
commit yourself to a baseless assumption?
You really believe...
Smoky Jail, undo!
I see you've made your decision.
Once I stopped to think about it,
it was pretty simple.
You used your cocoon after I played my card.
Since you went into hiding
only after learning my agenda,
I knew that was your ability,
and that it was a trap.
Your lack of reaction when I lifted
my pipe to strike confirmed it.
It made no sense that you showed
no sign of reacting at all.
Fifteen minutes.
That was how long I expected you to take
before deciding to remove the smoke barrier.
During that time, I intended to slip
through the smoke and move freely.
You trapped me within that barrier
to separate me from the King, yes?
Meaning, as long as your
prison of smoke was there,
your allies would see it and
conclude that I was still inside.
I decided to take advantage
of that misconception, and
quietly dispose of your friends.
I knew you would hesitate long enough
to give me plenty of time to act.
You thought I'd spend fifteen minutes
waiting in front of an empty cocoon?
You really underestimated me.
No, on the contrary, it appears...
I overestimated you!
He instantly broke himself up into tiny particles?
If that's how he broke through Smoky Jail,
I wouldn't have seen a thing!
You should have waited longer...
Because my strategy was a last resort.
To be honest, I was upset by the
fact that I'd been trapped.
Not a very good diversion strategy.
You just contradicted yourself.
You made it through the smoke just fine!
At that point, that was all there was to it.
I was under the impression that
you were a more capable soldier...
One who would carry out his original
plan and be faithful to his mission.
However, you made some wild guesses
and removed the barrier.
I must thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
Deep Purple!
Run!
I can't destroy them?
They just break up and reform?
He's invincible?
Thank you! Bye-bye!
Don't be fooled...
He's playing mind games!
My decision to attack the
cocoon was the best option.
No, the moment I second-guess myself,
I've played into his hands.
My next job
is to predict his objective, and stop him...
To join up with the rest of the Royal Guard,
to find and eliminate my companions,
and to reunite with the King!
That must be it...
His interests are consistent with mine.
There's no problem!
I'll take this!
He's fast!
I'll find somewhere safe to throw this away!
He got me...
I can't use any other abilities.
If Deep Purple is undone,
I'll be completely helpless!
I'll have to find a way to get by,
using Deep Purple alone.
Yo, are you
the esper?
What'd you do with Shoot, huh?
What?
Eighty-nine Deep Purple puppets...
The maximum number I could
produce in my current state.
I'll use them to support Knuckle as best I can.
I see what you're doing...
I'll let you hit me once.
But in return...
I'll take your life!
Okay, no one's here.
This is our chance to escape.
Let's go.
Man, they said we'd be safe here.
I can't get in touch with Leol-sama.
Since my stomach shrunk, that probably
means Cheetu-sama's dead...
And I haven't heard anything from
Flutter, so I guess that's it.
I'll leave to become a Queen!
I'll make you my second-in-command.
How's that?
Help...
Please...
get me out of here...
Help!
Oh, Secretary Bizeff...
You're in trouble.
I can't move my legs...
Whatever, let's go.
This looks dangerous.
What? Wait... Please!
I'm going to die!
No can do... I can't move all that.
Then, could you call for help?
Like, seriously...
I'm in a hurry to get out of this place!
The boss is missing, our link
with the King is gone,
and the palace is a mess.
I have no reason to stay here!
I'll give you whatever reward you want!
There are mountains of treasure underground!
If you help me, I'll give you anything you want.
So please pull me out!
Where underground?
There's an area for the Supreme
Leader beyond the shelter.
I've been managing the treasure inside.
I'm the only one with access...
You'll give me anything I want?
You'd better keep your promise.
Or I'll kill you!
Treasure! Treasure!
Treasure, treasure, treasure!
It's over...
This nation is finished.
That was clearly proven
when the air assault began before
I was able to make any arrangements.
They're probably calling the Ants biological
weapons, to use them as an excuse...
If I'm captured by the Federation,
they'll force me to confess for a cover
story and throw me in prison for life,
or they'll execute me, so I can't talk.
I won't let them capture me...
I'm going to escape!
The smoke-user is now out of action.
Now, I'll go back to the palace,
evaluate the current situation,
and return to the King.
Though I'm sure that even if I stay with him,
the King will only find me a nuisance.
Beelzebub!
Lord of the Flies
Beelzebub
Go forth, my clones...
Identify the location and status of
every person inside the palace!
Pouf's Beelzebub was an ability that allowed him
to disassemble into copies of himself
as small as one billionth his size.
He was able to control the size
and number of copies produced,
and the smaller the copies,
the more he could produce.
However, his main body,
which served as a control center,
could only be reduced to a bee's size.
Smoke-man, if you hadn't removed the barrier,
my main body could not have escaped.
My combat capacity would
have been reduced by half.
I'm sure a puppet master such as yourself
must know the incomparable difference in
strength between a clone and your own body.
Now that my main body is free,
I have no weaknesses.
You have lost.
You should have been more careful.
If you had, then when you realized
the cocoon was empty,
you should have wondered
whether what had been inside it
had actually escaped the barrier.
And if I had spoken to you
from outside the barrier,
you should have wondered whether
that was my real self.
The plan I executed was an act of desperation.
I could attempt to confuse your allies,
but my clones are mere husks.
Assuming that your allies were as strong as you,
even if it took a few casualties,
they would have noticed
that my clones were fakes!
Had you comprehended the truth,
and realized that my main body
remained within the barrier,
you would have understood my
ability, and searched for me.
If you had done so,
I would have had no way to
fight you in my reduced state...
In other words, if you had maintained
the barrier as per your original goal,
your allies may have suffered a bit,
but you would have been able to defeat me.
And I was ten-percent resolved
to accept that fate.
Your emotions were perfectly
aligned to accomplish that.
I suppose the explosion
must have thrown you off.
A pity...
However, I am now free.
Next, I will evaluate the situation in the palace!
From the start of the mission,
Morel's condition was less than optimal.
His exhaustion and impatience, combined
with the extreme tension of the situation,
clearly led him to the hasty decision
to engage Pouf in a battle of nerves.
However, he arrived at the
perfect time to support Knuckle,
keeping him from engaging Youpi alone.
As a result, it could be said that
he made the correct decision
to remove Smoky Jail at that time.
And it was more than simply
a product of coincidence.
It would be valid to say Morel's wealth of
experience played a role in saving him.
Upon entering the palace,
Morel had weighed the strength of the enemies
against that of his allies.
Subconsciously, he knew that they
had underestimated the enemy.
When he realized the length of time his allies
could hold out was shorter than anticipated,
he was led to attack the cocoon in order
to avoid struggling with the pros and cons
of removing Smoky Jail to go help them.
Morel's cunning, derived from his knowledge
of the battlefield, saved his comrades.
The real one's hidden among the fakes,
trying to attack me, right?
This time, I'll land a counter on you!
Five were taken out...
I have eighty-four left!
The smoke ones are fake.
They feel completely different.
When the real one lands a hit, I'll know.
That's when you'll be finished!
Seventy-five left!
Seventy-two...
Seventy...
Pitou and the woman are on the
west tower's second floor.
Pitou appears to be healing the woman.
A boy, who appears to be an
enemy, is sitting nearby.
Three near the entrance to
the underground shelter...
Hina, a Soldier Ant, and Bizeff!
They may be heading underground.
Welfin is behind them.
He appears to be following them.
The woman was injured by the dragon spears.
But why doesn't the enemy attack Pitou?
Could he be acquainted with the woman?
One in the soldiers' lounge, in the east tower...
The human captured a few days ago.
It will be born soon.
Oh, this area's crazy...
There are lots of enemies.
One, two, three...
But Youpi is taking them out quickly.
Youpi and approximately fifty enemies
are in the north area of the palace!
It's the smoke-guy and a bunch of thugs.
Also, a weird fatso with a spike on its head!
Unable to determine if it is friend or foe.
Is the spike-head Youpi's true power?
Only one of the thugs is real,
while the rest are made of smoke.
The number of puppets is not increasing
because he needs the pipe to make more.
It'll take Youpi less than a minute
to find the real one.
The King is gone! Where is he?
Everyone, return!
What's wrong?
You're running out of clones.
My attacks are too fast for you to get close.
Should I leave an opening for
him to come in and attack?
Carefully...
Act natural.
Here you go...
Come on!
He's a fake?
Wait...
You finally figured it out, idiot?
There never was a real one.
I'll kill you!
There is a real one, right here!
No kidding!
An aura explosion?
From Youpi?
Did he really need to use such an ability?
I'm worried...
But locating the King is my first priority!
You saved me, boss!
If you hadn't set that restriction,
I would have snapped and rushed him!
Listen to me...
I will create only angry clones of you
when you've lost control of your temper.
If that happens, you are to join the clones,
and give careful thought to what must be done.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got it.
After cooling down and thinking about it,
I realized that he wouldn't have taken Shoot.
But if Shoot couldn't move on his own,
who would have moved him?
Damn... Stop thinking about it!
I need to focus on the opponent before me!
Where...
am I?
That's...
Uh-oh!
Hurry up!
Go in before the entrance is blocked!
Damn, Bizeff is my prey!
If I knew what powers they had,
I could make a move.
Don't come any closer...
Pouf!
Next time: Defeat x and x Dignity.
I'm Gon.
And that's all there is to it.
I'm Killua!
And that's all there is to it.
﻿Don't come any closer...
Pouf!
Defeat x And x Dignity
Why?
Had you remained silent,
I could have killed him.
Why are you so needlessly frightened?
He noticed you.
If you'd approached him with the intent to kill,
he would have immediately attacked Komugi.
That was a risk I didn't want to take.
Your words baffle me.
Isn't he sitting there because
he wants to help that girl?
You almost make it sound like
he means to harm her.
Why?
It's none of your business.
Shut up.
Once I'm charged up, I'm going back to Gon.
You go find Knuckle.
Pouf is outside the barrier,
so it's very likely the big guy was taken out.
Review the situation,
then you and Knuckle decide what
to do, and whether to retreat.
Wh-What about you guys?
Once Gon is in that state, he won't budge.
At worst, he'll trade his life for Pitou's.
I'm kidding!
It'll be fine.
I've always got the magic word, "Kite"!
I have it under control.
Really?
Then why did you
look so sad back there?
You're sure, then?
You can't talk... And you don't want to, anyway.
Then I can't ask, and I don't want to!
It's none of your business.
Shut up.
Shut up?
Downwind, huh?
Am I interrupting something?
Pitou, I'll let you handle this, then.
Don't move.
Stay right there.
You can use your wing scales to control others, right?
Don't take a single step.
Pouf, please!
Are you insane?
You want me to stand here and do nothing?
For that woman's sake?
For the King's sake!
Do as he says...
What happened?
Your expression has changed...
What happened while I was trapped?
I promise that I shall not move from this spot.
In return, I want you to tell me
everything that has happened thus far.
If I ask where the King is, he'll
get suspicious and silence us.
Drop me hints while you explain what's happened.
Be careful to make it sound quite natural.
If you fail, we will see bloodshed.
That's all there is to it.
It's time.
Adding interest.
I've got it...
I could feel myself controlling the explosion.
If I try it once more, I'll have it mastered.
I need rage...
I must build up my rage before
I forget how it felt!
That's the second time you've
made a fool out of me!
Scum! Trash!
Piece of crap!
Stay calm, and let rage consume me...
Create and destroy at the same time.
Manifested through this body!
Youpi had yet to notice
why two conflicting emotions
could exist simultaneously...
Or what his current predicament was.
Rage...
Rage is not intended to be scattered.
It's meant to be focused on a target!
I Will Destroy You!!!
I will destroy you!
Okay! Okay!
It's a fake, okay!
Keep it up...
Make me madder!
Come on!
It's time.
Adding interest.
APR's interest is calculated
assuming that aura consumption will
continue to rise at the current rate.
Even if Youpi were to reduce his
aura usage to a bare minimum,
in another three minutes and fifty seconds,
he would reach the point at which
he would be unable to use Nen.
Ten left.
My back's against the wall...
Looks like he's saving me for last.
In that case, I'll keep fighting as long as I can!
Morel had deployed all of his puppets
close enough for Youpi to see
so that he'd be able to monitor Youpi's movements,
but also because he no longer had the
strength to move his puppets around.
If he lost his focus, the puppets would
return to smoke and dissipate.
It shouldn't be much longer...
He has to run out of Nen at some point.
But...
But damn...
My body and soul...
refuse to move.
At this point, Morel could not
even will himself to stand.
He had literally reached his limit
even before Youpi went bankrupt.
Zero left...
I have something to say to you.
Now that Youpi had learned
how to store his rage elsewhere,
his head was much clearer.
You look like a little fly that's about to die.
And yet...
That's what makes you guys amazing.
During the battle, Youpi had
evolved at an alarming rate,
increasing the gap between
the Hunters and himself.
Yet he had nothing but praise for the defeated.
Given Morel's initial impression of Youpi,
this must have been the last thing he
expected Youpi to say in this situation.
But Morel could honestly accept
that this was Youpi's true nature.
I'm not sure how to say this...
But because you've impressed me,
I have to be sure to kill you.
It's only proper, I guess?
This is game over.
Well, I'll end this with one blow.
Don't move.
I don't think I even mind letting him
kill me now.
Bye.
He disappeared?
There's blood...
What's going on?
It wasn't teleportation?
The moment I was about to cut through him,
he disappeared.
I thought that one of them had the
ability to use teleportation...
But when he disappeared,
I didn't see anyone else.
And I struck before he disappeared, so if
he teleported, I shouldn't have drawn blood.
But I was able to cut him.
Yet I can no longer see him.
Does that mean he only turned invisible?
An ability to become transparent?
If he had that ability,
he would have used it sooner.
Which means one of the others
must be able to make himself
and the rest invisible.
And right before I connected, he tried
to save the guy with the sunglasses.
But I left a deep wound.
Here he comes!
The blood...
Youpi can follow the blood!
We may be invisible, but the
blood is leaving a trail.
If he swings that blade again,
I'll have to get away by myself.
I'm running out of breath...
Damn it!
Knuckle?!
Why did you reveal yourself?
Right now, your job is to stay
hidden as long as possible!
I'm done running and hiding.
I'll face you.
So...
Let them escape.
Knuckle chose to use words instead of his fists
because Youpi's words had
struck a chord with him.
You're crazy.
You can't even call that a trade-off.
My answer
is no.
However...
If you get rid of this thing,
my answer might change.
I'm sure this has to do with why you've
been constantly on the run.
Removing it will make the
exchange more even.
No... Don't do it!
Knuckle, you'd better not be stupid!
Morel's desperate cry did not reach
Knuckle due to God's Accomplice.
However, it did return Meleoron to his senses.
Leave me here...
You can't!
You can't do that, Knuckle!
Don't worry about me...
Will you waste everything we've done?
Everything that Morel, and Shoot...
and you...
have done by risking your lives!
If Knuckle didn't act, the two of
them could still fight together.
To do that, Meleoron had to stay hidden.
With that in mind, the decision that
Meleoron made after leaving Morel...
Knuckle!
Knuckle!
...ended up backfiring.
Impossible...
We no longer have a way...
to defeat Youpi...
Why...
The sight of a bloody Morel had reminded
Knuckle of Shoot, and broken him.
Okay... I took away APR!
Now the terms are even.
Leave the boss alone!
Fight me!
Kill me!
No way.
Hold on!
Where are you going?!
To the King, obviously.
Do you want to come with me?
I doubt you could handle it.
His ability isn't teleportation, is it?
Then you'll have to carry the
guy in sunglasses to a doctor,
or you struck this deal for nothing.
If protecting the King was his first priority,
he should have killed all three on the spot.
It's no big deal...
You weaklings can attack me all you
want, but I'll still shake you off.
The fact that he was aware of this,
but didn't carry it out,
irritated Youpi on a level that didn't
compare to his previous rage.
Come for me whenever you want.
I'll fight you as equals.
I don't need to kill you right now...
And that's all there is to it!
Damn, I picked up Pouf's habit.
During this battle, Youpi had learned
how profound Nen really was.
That also altered what little
sense of self he'd had before.
Having learned to quarantine
his rage and stay calm,
Youpi had lost his ability to
see things in simple terms.
They're responsible for the rage I've built up,
so why don't I feel like using it on them?
What, or who, am I supposed
to unleash this rage upon?
Was this a sign of maturation?
Youpi wasn't sure.
However, as for Knuckle...
I completely lost...
Knuckle!
We gotta help the big guy!
Come on, boss.
I told you to leave me here...
Go!
The two of you...
can still fight.
Do what you can.
He said to go whenever you want.
So go now!
I can't.
I can no longer think of him...
as a target to destroy.
Wait...
He acknowledged our efforts.
He wasn't a bad guy.
In that case, I no longer have...
any reason to defeat him.
The King...
Knov-san!
The soldiers are not important.
If the King waves his baton, the soldiers
will become demons if necessary.
I'll take care of Morel...
Shoot is also okay.
Are you guys also coming?
Wait, let me sock this baby hard.
I received a message from
the chairman's messenger.
As planned, he was able to take the
King to the appointed location.
If they leave now, the Royal
Guard won't make it in time.
Their job is done, and so is ours.
Where's Palm?
We don't know yet.
Okay...
What will you do?
I don't know if I'll be back again.
You can see how bad I look...
Are you going or staying?
We're staying.
We still have a job to do.
I see.
You're strong...
Let's go.
To look for Palm?
No, we can do that later.
There's something else we have to do.
Youpi isn't the only Royal Guard!
Next time: Pose x And x Name.
Hey, Killua... Say my name.
Huh? Why now?
Just do it!
Gon.
Killua.
﻿I can no longer think of him...
as a target to destroy.
He acknowledged our efforts.
He wasn't a bad guy.
In that case, I no longer have...
any reason to defeat him.
The King...
The soldiers are not important.
If the King waves his baton, the soldiers
will become demons if necessary.
Pose x And x Name
This is an area used for testing weapons of war.
We won't need to restrain ourselves.
Why do you fight?
You have no chance of defeating me.
Why rush to your death?
You presume to know I cannot win?
You know nothing about me.
If you judge me by my appearance,
you'll get burned.
You have it backwards.
You don't seem like some ordinary man
who can't read the state of the battle.
I was born to rule this world.
Originally, you humans were as
no more than livestock to me.
But I have changed my mind.
I learned that there are a few
humans worth keeping alive.
Like that woman.
I sense that you are worthy, as well.
If you back down now,
I am willing to spare your life.
You'll only spare my life, yes?
Given my position,
I can't accept that offer.
Meanwhile...
In exchange for his agreement to stay still,
Pouf was pressing Pitou to explain
just what had happened.
Pitou complied with Pouf's request, telling
him what happened after the attack.
In other words, everything since
they'd been separated.
Pitou made it a point to include
details that Gon did not know,
to ensure that Gon's attention would
be focused on the explanation.
Pitou deliberately did not mention
how the King had held Komugi
because Pitou did not know how to
describe the events accurately.
There was no significant change in Gon.
However...
Pitou knew the plan had succeeded
when Gon's eyes wavered briefly.
The King...
left with the enemy of his own
volition, by that doorway.
There is no need for us to go.
I see.
He went south.
I understand.
A fine play, Pitou.
Then we should await the King's return here.
To maintain only my outward appearance,
I only need one-seventh of my flies.
The other six-sevenths
will go to the King!
You fight with the resolve to lose?
I do not understand.
You fight for the human race?
If so, then know that my actions
are, in fact, for their benefit.
For example, in human society,
lands are divided by national borders,
much like territorial marking.
On the right side of the border,
children may starve to death.
While on the left, scum who do nothing
have everything they need.
Absolute madness.
I shall crush that madness...
And create a world so fair,
the very concept of inequality will be forgotten!
I concede that
I will initially use power and terror
to accomplish my objective.
But I will only do so to the extent
necessary to maintain order.
I have learned what power
is meant to be used for.
To protect the weak,
who deserve to live.
Power is not meant to be used
to torment the defeated!
This could be a problem...
I shall not fight you.
I agreed to leave the palace
so we could have a free, open discussion.
He's wavering...
Come closer.
Wavering between Ant and human.
And he hasn't realized
that those two sides are incompatible.
And neither one
is dominant yet.
But regardless of which side he falls to,
the outcome won't change.
We're counting on you.
You have a single mission.
The immediate extermination
of these dangerous creatures.
There have already been many casualties.
We will use any means necessary.
Will that be acceptable?
Naturally, we have no intention of
telling the experts how to proceed.
We simply desire
those dangerous creatures
eradicated as swiftly as possible.
Understood.
So their goal is to eradicate the Ants,
leaving the Hunters Association
to take the blame.
I must make this fast...
Before my heart is swayed.
King...
We are both in difficult positions.
100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva
100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva!
First Hand
First Hand!
That's...
I can't sense anyone else fighting.
Does that mean I'm the only one left?
Youpi!
Pouf!
You've changed a lot since I last saw you.
I could say the same to you.
I had to escape without alerting the enemy.
And if I move all my dispersed particles
at once, it's too conspicuous.
So I must go slowly.
I'm sure you're feeling impatient,
but please spare me a moment.
I need to tell you what's happening.
Well, I suppose you have your own concerns...
You've grown up.
And there you have it.
I have no conclusive proof
that the change in Pitou will
actually benefit the King...
Through his own experiences,
Youpi could understand Pitou's behavior.
Youpi...
What do you think we should do?
This was a test.
Which made it very clear to Youpi
that Pouf was fearful of the subtle changes
Pitou and Youpi had undergone.
A foolish question.
We must go
to the King at once!
And that's all there is to it... Right?
His response was entirely sincere.
Indeed.
He was concerned only with
leaving as soon as possible.
Because Youpi was feeling the same fear.
I'm sure that was a direct hit...
He's tough!
A good attack.
I could not anticipate it.
Are you satisfied now?
He still wants me to sit with him?
I shall not repeat myself.
Third Hand
Third Hand!
I can no longer back down!
Are you really so eager to die?
From the King's perspective,
the wrath that was unleashed
was no stronger than that
of a child throwing a fit.
Yet it was violent enough to induce
Netero to more than double the distance
between the King and him.
It was an insult likened to laughing off
Netero's declaration that
he would not back down.
Come on...
You will only influence me by using words.
Damned newborn brat.
If it were that simple,
I wouldn't have to do this!
Wait...
By using...
words?
King...
Would you like to know your name?
How would you know my name?
My subordinates were present at the
moment of your mother's passing.
She uttered your name with her dying breath.
And my subordinates may have died
fighting your Royal Guard by now.
Interested in fighting me now?
If you can force me to admit defeat,
I will tell you your name.
Force you to admit defeat
without killing you?
So, similar to a bishop and rook handicap...
No matter.
I shall checkmate you shortly.
The real battle between Netero
and the King has begun.
Next time: Centipede x And x Memory.
Hey, what do you want to be in your next life?
Uh, what do you want to be?
In my next life, I want to be me,
and meet you again.
Stupid!
﻿Wait...
By using...
words?
King...
Would you like to know your name?
How would you know my name?
My subordinates were present at the
moment of your mother's passing.
She uttered your name with her dying breath.
And my subordinates may have died
fighting your Royal Guard by now.
Interested in fighting me now?
If you can force me to admit defeat,
I will tell you your name.
Force you to admit defeat without killing you?
So, similar to a bishop and rook handicap...
No matter.
I shall checkmate you shortly.
Centipede x And x Memory
As the King and Netero prepared
for their final battle...
Beneath the palace, Ikalgo was still sobbing,
having failed to finish off
the unconscious Brovada.
Fire! This is the best option!
There's no one else to help me!
I h-have to...
kill him!
This is no time to be crying...
I have to find Palm!
Huh?
The door to the warehouse area is open.
So is the door leading to the garage!
Why?
Don't move!
If you move, I'll attack.
Welfin...
I have a lot of things to ask you.
If you seem to be trying anything funny,
I'll kill you!
What he wants to ask me
is obvious!
The number of my allies,
their roles,
and their abilities.
And he intends to use any means
necessary to get the answers.
People could die if I leak information.
If he's a Manipulator,
he can obtain the information against my will.
Huh?
D-Don't move!
I really will kill you!
Go ahead... Kill me.
That's what I want!
Stop!
If the alternative is betraying my buddies,
I'll take you with me!
Ouch!
Bastard! Now you've done it!
Damn it!
I'll kill you!
Missile Man!
I'm... not dead...
I didn't sustain any damage.
What was that attack?
Damn, that hurts...
You little punk...
Damn...
That bastard... How did a wimp like
that figure out my weakness?
Missile Man requires questions and answers to work.
If an enemy attacks before I can ask
a question, it's null and void!
The wound isn't deep...
I'll take my time beating him to a pulp.
Huh?
He planted something inside me?
Those were created by my Nen.
They're black centipedes.
Black Centipede
They grow by feeding on your resistance.
If you disobey my orders or try to hurt me,
you'll suffer excruciating pain,
then they'll tear your body apart and you'll die!
Wh-What are you doing, fool?
Weren't you listening to me?
If you try to do that...
That's fine with me.
If my life is all it takes, I'll give it!
S-Stop!
No, wait...
If he wanted to kill me, that's the
ultimate form of resistance.
Now, it'll take no time for the black centipedes
to grow large enough to kill him instantly!
Don't worry.
I'm not interested in killing you...
I just need to make sure that you can't leave.
I still...
have plenty of bullets.
Bastard! Don't mess with me!
I'll kill you!
You're dead! I'll kill you!
It's so easy.
When I'm prepared to offer my own life,
it's so easy to pull the trigger.
I g-get it...
I get it, already.
I won't go anywhere!
I surrender.
Please... Don't fire!
The pain is going away.
The creatures inside me are suffering?
I lose, damn it...
I can't move anymore.
Is it because Welfin admitted defeat?
Man, I knew it...
I had a feeling this would happen eventually.
But still...
I didn't think I was this weak!
I didn't think it'd be so scary
to face someone who fights
with no regard for their own life!
Hey.
What?
The pain has stopped, but can
you get rid of these bugs?
Stop complaining...
I'm in too much pain to think about that now!
Hurry up.
Give me a minute!
I don't have a way to deactivate Missile Man.
But if I tell the truth, I'm in real trouble...
Damn, how do I get out of this?
I need to buy time...
Until I can come up with a good idea.
The pain is making me...
feel faint...
Wait! Okay!
I was lying! I won't do it again!
Then get rid of these.
Yeah, uh...
So, the thing is...
Forget it. I see how it is.
Wait! Hold on!
I can't remove them!
Not once they've been activated!
That's why I didn't want to say anything.
It's the truth! Believe me!
I'm not trying to trick you!
The insects are in pain again.
Maybe because Welfin is telling the truth?
Can you really blame me?
I only use this attack when I want to kill someone.
I never cared what happened after that.
I never gave any thought to
what happened to my enemy.
Nen abilities are really something.
My abilities reflect my own personality.
My personality? His true intentions?
Welfin...
What do I ask him?
What do I want to know?
I once knew someone just like him.
Do you have any memories from
when you were human?
Wh-Why are you asking about that?
I can't remember...
You're lying.
Wh-What?
Stop! Hold on!
Calm down!
If you don't tell me the truth, I'll shoot you.
When I woke up,
my first thought was...
Damn...
I can still remember it.
I'm sure those monster bugs killed me in NGL.
I was fed to the Queen,
and reborn as something new...
But I still...
I still remember the one thing
I most wanted to forget.
The sight of my father strangling me,
and the woman watching behind him.
At first, I only had flashbacks of it.
Over time, I remembered the
entire sequence of events.
I was saved by...
my little brother, who was unrelated by blood.
I remember now!
He looked just like Gyro!
Gyro?
You know. The king!
We used to brag about whose
life was more miserable.
He was the only one I could
turn to when I needed
to laugh away my tears...
We were both empty.
So we had nothing to hide.
I wonder what he's doing now...
I want to see him one more time...
Yes, I just want to see Gyro.
I'm tired of dealing with Ants and humans,
with money and nations...
Go.
The bugs are gone.
You still have something to do.
Why did you open the doors?
Oh, I was letting those weaklings
reach the treasure in the back.
They can't put up much of a fight.
I was watching you and Bro on the monitor.
And I told them to pass while
you were on the way back.
A coward!
It was that simple.
Once I saw that you couldn't finish Bro,
I thought you'd be an easy target.
I couldn't have been more wrong.
Go on.
I'm too tired to move...
I have one last question.
Did you see a woman in the palace?
A woman?
Not sure if it's the one you're talking about,
but the Royal Guard captured a human,
and put her in a cocoon.
Where is she?
Take the elevator up, then turn left.
It's the room at the end of the hall.
They called it #1.
Thank you!
What's so funny?
Telling the truth
feels really good...
Welfin had spent his life unable
to trust himself or others.
Telling Ikalgo the location of
the one he searched for
was the first time he'd opened
up and spoken honestly.
Next time: Breakdown x And x Awakening.
I'm just... I'm just...
What's wrong, Killua?
I'm here for you.
﻿Approximately thirty minutes after
the Hunters entered the palace...
As the fierce battle unfolded inside the palace,
an immense number of citizens
hypnotized by Pouf's wing scales
still waited outside for the selection process
that would turn them into soldier ants.
Meanwhile, a creature in the form that
they would soon become began to stir.
Breakdown x And x Awakening
Okay, all charged up.
Someone's watching me.
And...
It's probably someone I know.
No one's there?
While her appearance hadn't totally changed,
Palm was clearly no longer the same person.
And that greatly disturbed Killua.
She was captured
by the Royal Guard...
And she's been transformed!
If Gon sees what's happened to Palm,
he won't be able to take it...
There's no room left in his heart.
If the transformation has
reached as far as Palm's heart...
I can see Gon completely breaking down!
I must learn the answer.
We still have a chance.
Palm approached me herself!
Palm?
Palm must have sensed me
before I noticed her watching me...
Using that power she told us about before.
Once I used my power, it was quite simple.
I thought she could use some kind
of divination to locate people.
But it's probably closer to clairvoyance.
From her position, Palm shouldn't
have been able to see me...
The only conclusion is that she was
watching me by some other means.
And if Palm were an enemy,
she would have backed off...
Clairvoyance is most effective from a distance.
And if she's an enemy, she shouldn't
remember me anymore.
Since she approached me,
she must remember me...
Remember us!
Killua, yes?
I knew it...
She has her memories!
Where's Gon?
Once he's seen what I've
become, will Gon hate me?
Gon doesn't judge people by appearances.
And you're assuming that he
doesn't already hate you.
You're always so spiteful...
Well, it doesn't matter.
I have nothing to gain from your pity.
Where's Gon?
Gon's with Pitou.
He's—
Why can she see me,
but she can't see Gon?
What's wrong?
Was it chance that you happened to find me?
Huh? What are you talking about?
You're the one who turned the corner.
Wrong! I sensed you watching me.
That's why I came this way!
You noticed me first.
Why are you lying?
Troublesome brat...
Where's Gon?
Answer my question first.
Did I notice Palm watching me
only when she physically saw me?
Does that mean Palm actually
saw me once, then immediately left?
Then she used clairvoyance
to watch me follow her,
and turned around so it'd look
like she was approaching me?
For the last time...
Where's Gon?
I won't tell you.
You're an enemy, aren't you?
I made a mistake...
I used my power incorrectly.
When I was brimming with rage,
I should have let my emotions take over!
Black Widow
Dark Demon Goddess
Sh-She's dangerous!
Better to let everything out than hold it in.
That includes my desire to kill you!
Well? What now?
Will you die without a word?
Will you die after speaking?
Or will you just die?
Palm's ability to arm herself by covering
her body with her hair, Black Widow,
varied in appearance according
to her emotional state.
But defense was its primary function.
What made Black Widow frightening
was the fact that she could rely on
her hair armor for protection,
allowing her to devote all
her energy to her attacks.
P-Palm-san! Turn off your Hatsu!
Palm is an Enhancer.
When everything clicks, it's possible
to become this much stronger?
I completely blocked the attack,
but I still took damage.
If the fight drags on, I'll be at a total disadvantage.
But I can't run away.
Gon's mind is already at its limit!
He's barely holding himself together,
while he waits for Pitou.
I can't let them meet.
Even if Palm's heart is still there...
It'll have a negative effect now!
Palm!
Why are you looking for Gon?
Depending on why, I might be
willing to tell you where he is.
Huh? Why are you asking now?
There's no reason...
I just want to see him.
He's probably nearby.
I'll find him myself.
Once I've killed you!
Sorry!
I panicked and called you an enemy...
But even if you look different,
you're still Palm, right?
Gon is suffering.
Someone he deeply respects
was completely transformed.
That person had his soul taken away.
Right now, Gon is facing off
against the one responsible!
If you appear before Gon
looking as you do now...
Gon will...
totally snap.
So you have to
call him by his name first.
You must say, "Gon."
That's the condition.
Tell him you're okay.
Before we entered the palace,
Gon was really worried about you.
Give him some peace of mind...
He was just buying time.
He had no intention of letting them meet.
That was the idea...
Help...
make him feel a little better, if you can...
Only you can do that now!
No one else...
can do it.
I can't...
do anything!
Once he'd said those words,
the dam within him burst.
He's completely defenseless.
Change in plans...
Kill him now, #1!
When Palm had infiltrated the palace,
arriving at the exit Knov had
placed near the stairway,
Pitou's En returned.
Surrounded by aura so evil that she felt
as though she'd be crushed to dust,
she reached the same conclusion Knov had.
As she watched Pouf slowly and silently
descend the stairs, she made her decision.
She plotted to take her own life,
so she would look like a despairing girl
who could not bear Bizeff violating her.
However, Pitou prevented that from happening.
As one cannot help but shiver in the cold,
no one could blame Palm for reflexively using aura
to protect herself from Pitou's evil aura
at the moment she was exposed to it.
The Royal Guard was interested in her aura,
and after receiving permission from the fasting King,
Pitou and Pouf made her experimental soldier #1.
Precedent had demonstrated those who remembered
their pasts had stronger mental fortitude.
This was most noticeable in Ants who
had learned how to use Nen.
Memories of the past tended to both assist
and deter the growth of soldiers.
Deterrence generally happened
when memories led to emotional reactions.
Thus, the two Royal Guards concluded
that they should use Pitou's Dr. Blythe
to destroy the connection between
Palm's memories and her emotions.
The experiments that produced Cheetu
and Leol confirmed that those
who retained more of their memories
emerged from their cocoons sooner.
To quickly and quietly conquer humanity,
leaving soldiers with their memories, while
keeping control of them, would be best.
Palm was the perfect test subject.
The success of her experiment would
signify the end of the human race.
Now go, #1...
Beat the kid before you to death!
Shut up.
I am
Palm Siberia.
I'm not #1!
I will never become a pawn to you Ants...
Even if it costs my life!
Killua...
I have you to thank.
There was a wall inside my head.
My emotions were separated from my body.
I couldn't do anything about it.
I've been like this since I woke up.
You removed the barrier.
Don't say that there's nothing you can do.
If I can do anything to help Gon, I'll be happy to.
But you must not forget...
You are the one Gon needs most.
What is it?
Failure.
That's all there is to it.
Slow and steady it is.
Soldiers do not need memories or emotions...
Which also means I no longer need Pitou's power.
I can create soldiers on my own!
That will make it easier
to build a new kingdom
for the King and me.
Next time: Great Power x And x Ultimate Power
Oh, Knuckle... You're lending me this manga?
Wait, this is mine.
Oh, well.
﻿Killua...
I have you to thank.
I've been like this since I woke up.
Don't say that there's nothing you can do.
If I can do anything to help Gon, I'll be happy to.
But you must not forget...
You are the one Gon needs most.
Great Power x And x Ultimate Power
Killua's voiced feelings toward Gon
miraculously returned Palm to her old self.
Meanwhile, on the west tower's second floor,
Knuckle had ignored Meleoron's repeated warnings,
appearing before those in the room
in order to challenge Pouf.
Pouf...
Step outside.
Very well.
I will face you.
But first, I have something to say.
That which stands before you is only a clone.
My true body is already on its way to the King.
Having escaped the cage of smoke,
Pouf had confirmed that Knuckle
and Morel had made contact.
He decided to assume
that his enemies knew of
his ability to create clones,
and to act accordingly.
That was the correct call.
The boss told me that you could make clones.
You're telling the truth.
Knuckle said this aloud for Gon's sake.
By telling the truth first, Pouf attempted
to gain the mental advantage.
His plan was a success.
But why are you telling me this?
Pouf's concern was Youpi.
Since Knuckle was here,
that meant that Youpi had spared his life
and had not told Pouf this.
Depending on his reason...
Answer me!
To satisfy him.
Pouf needed to leave the room peacefully
so that he could persuade Knuckle
to tell him the motive behind the
transformation he'd sensed in Youpi.
I told you in order to satisfy him.
He has demanded that I not leave this room.
If we are to engage in a duel,
I will need him to withdraw his
demand, so that I may leave.
I am but a clone...
I cannot use my wing scales.
However, I am still willing to fight you.
What I seek is a discussion.
That is why I revealed the truth.
Pouf knew that when dealing with someone who
would call him from behind to challenge him,
appearing to be telling the truth
would be more effective.
You're lying...
You were going to kill me from behind.
You even admitted it.
Knuckle, don't let him fool you!
First, you claim to be a clone.
Are you able to prove that?
He's right.
This boy is proving troublesome.
I dare say that, of our enemies,
he possesses the strongest will.
Perhaps I should be pleased
that he is trapped here with Pitou.
Because his strong will keeps him in here.
Were I to prove myself a clone, I would
be placing myself at a disadvantage.
So I can say nothing.
You must use your own judgment.
And...
I shall allow you
to decide what happens next.
Pouf, you can't mean to...
Stop...
I'll wait in front of the entrance for ten minutes.
Whether you come or not is your choice!
Please wait...
I'm still here!
I apologize for Pouf's behavior!
I'm the only one you need, right?
Ten minutes.
You have ten fewer minutes to heal her.
Pitou was trembling.
It was disturbing enough that
Pouf had been willing to leave,
despite the consequences.
But what was truly frightening was
how Gon ignored Pouf's taunts,
calmly moving up the deadline instead.
How long?
How long do I have to wait?
To completely heal her
will take three to four hours.
No, I can't wait that long.
If I have an hour,
I can heal her most critical injuries.
Originally, to protect Komugi
and heal her completely,
Pitou had deliberately named a longer
time frame than was necessary,
which Gon had denied.
So the hour that they'd agreed
upon was the actual time
Pitou believed necessary for Komugi
to make a full recovery.
However,
Doctor Blythe had grown stronger over time.
It may have been possible
to speed up the treatment by ten minutes.
Upon thinking this, Pitou realized...
It may have been mere coincidence,
but it was likely that Gon had only chosen ten
minutes to conform with Pouf's parting words.
Despite that likelihood, Pitou
could not shake a bad feeling.
I must risk my life.
Or else his fangs
may reach the King's throat!
I understand.
Knuckle.
I'll be fine here alone.
I said that Pouf was lying,
but it's probably true that his main
body is headed for the King.
The King is to the south.
Gon and Killua had seen everything
that had transpired.
But since Pitou did not know that,
it was only natural to assume that Gon
had seen through Pouf's plans.
Pitou's worst fears had been confirmed.
Pitou was now fully resolved to
complete the mission at hand.
I must kill him.
No matter the cost!
I must kill him...
For the King's sake!
Do I move as soon as Komugi is healed?
No, that won't work.
I can't expose her to danger.
First, I must entrust her to someone else.
Pouf and Youpi dislike Komugi.
This won't do.
If I'm gone, who will take Komugi to the King?
Gon,
I understand what you're saying.
However...
I will still do things my way.
Youpi is...
No, never mind.
If Knuckle's information made Gon hesitant,
it could result in his death.
See ya.
Knuckle managed to stop himself.
How would you know my name?
My subordinates were present at the
moment of your mother's passing.
She uttered your name with her dying breath.
And my subordinates may have died
fighting your Royal Guard by now.
Interested in fighting me now?
If you can force me to admit defeat,
I will tell you your name.
Force you to admit defeat without killing you?
So, similar to a bishop and rook handicap...
No matter.
I shall checkmate you shortly.
As the King moved into his stance,
Netero took to the air.
When was it...
that I began to wait for my opponent to attack?
Whenever you're ready,
come at me.
100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva...
100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva
Ninety-ninth Hand
Ninety-ninth Hand!
When was it
that I stopped hesitating to be gracious,
taking the hands of vanquished opponents
when they bowed their heads in defeat?
That cannot be
the ultimate power I sought!
It is fighting with all my soul against
an opponent with the strength to defeat me!
This is a tomb.
Your tomb.
I am very thankful.
Thankful for everything
that has made our meeting possible!
Next time: Zero x And x Rose.
We haven't seen each other in a while.
Yeah.
But it feels like you were always with me.
Yeah.
The future is ours.
﻿This is a tomb.
Your tomb.
I am very thankful.
Thankful for everything
that has made our meeting possible!
Zero x And x Rose
As his time was compressed to its utmost limits,
the King, his consciousness alone barely following
the afterimages of Netero's movements,
found that a single emotion reigned within him...
Complete and utter admiration for his enemy.
That's it.
He brings his hands together to start the attack.
That's the only motion he has
that far surpasses my speed.
Such wasted movement could
cost one's life in battle,
but now, it works as a weapon
that may allow him to defeat me.
Trying to guess what drove
him to do this is pointless.
It would have required choosing
a path that defies reason.
I would presume that, at one point,
he was on the verge of madness...
Five years... Perhaps ten years...
And the entire time, he focused on this alone.
I recognize that
you have dedicated an incredible amount of time
to achieve the power you have displayed.
After all that, he's barely been scratched.
Not that I expected any different.
An individual
can reach his limit after much training.
You are a rare example of one
who has transcended that limit.
Bravo.
You have earned my praise.
An insect
should not talk down to humans!
The King's strategy was quite simple.
Keep attacking.
If the only attack capable of besting him,
100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva,
could do next to no damage,
the King had no cause for fear.
These are no more than dummy hands.
They can only move in set patterns.
If I attack from an angle that he can't
block with a move he's already used,
he'll have no choice but to reveal a new move.
Once I have verified all of the combinations,
I can find the angle of attack that will
force him to reveal another new move.
However, while he may have a limited
number of attack patterns,
the number of combinations they can
be used in may as well be infinite.
But every individual has a rhythm.
There will be an unconscious bias for,
and against, certain patterns,
and that bias naturally shapes one's identity.
If I can identify his personal rhythm,
I have a fair chance of guessing
which patterns he will select.
To find the single correct needle
among countless millions,
and thread it accurately...
is what it will take to pierce my target.
It may prove difficult...
But I will succeed.
I can accomplish it!
Old soldier, I beg of you...
Don't lose your life before I succeed!
He's laughing?
Well, I'm also enjoying myself, so I can't blame him.
No matter my attack trajectory,
he recovers immediately and moves to counter.
If I make a wrong move, his speed won't
allow me time to unleash the next Hand.
If I lose focus, he'll tear me
apart before I realize it.
This is a contest of endurance, in which
I must keep choosing correctly...
When I fail, you win.
That's probably what you're thinking, Ant King!
No matter.
I shall checkmate you shortly.
Checkmate me if you can.
I'll show you my Zero Hand!
After hundreds and thousands of hits,
the King was beginning to feel the slightest
hints of dull pain within his body.
However...
Stop the bleeding.
Then tell me my name.
You have done well for a human.
What's wrong?
If you don't act, you'll die of blood loss.
Don't make me laugh.
I'll die?
You shouldn't get cocky after
landing a lucky punch...
The battle's just begun!
You have truly earned my admiration.
I am amazed that your spirit has not flagged.
However, losing your leg was basically inevitable.
It is the consequence of using a defense that,
while not bad, was not the best choice.
After playing against Komugi, I learned
the art of anticipating enemy actions.
Your unconscious bias against certain patterns
gives me insight into the otherwise
limitless options you have.
Next, I'll take your left arm.
The ensuing fight
did not even last a minute.
This is
my life's final act!
As he released his 100-Type, Netero's resolve
heightened his physical and mental senses,
resulting in an exchange of more
than a thousand punches,
and sparking countless fireworks
between the combatants.
And then, the moment arrived.
His attacks began to show a slight inclination,
one not quite significant enough
to be called a habit or bias.
After using his body to bear the
brunt of Netero's attacks,
the King was able to find
the faint light beyond, and...
he reached it.
Are you satisfied now?
Then tell me my name.
Ant King...
You believe I cannot pray with a single arm?
A prayer comes from the heart.
If the heart achieves the correct
form, it becomes emotion...
And emotions may be manifested.
100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva Zero Hand
was a Buddha that appeared behind an enemy,
gently enveloping the target
with an indiscriminate love.
Previously, Killua had sensed its murderous
intent from a great distance away.
Not this way!
It had left such a strong impact,
Killua had changed his direction.
The entirety of Netero's aura
was transformed into a light as
blinding as a star, and fired
with a merciless roar.
The pinnacle of individual strength.
That was a magnificent attack.
Zero wasn't enough?
I was born to be King of the Ants,
to rule over all organisms.
I represent the instinctive hope
long nurtured by my species,
and that species continues to evolve for my sake.
I stand here now, the resulting boon
of the total support of my species.
You are an individual human, not a king...
I am the King that bears his kind's fate.
That was the difference in this battle.
The Chimera Ants' long evolution
has culminated in me.
This is a feat the human race, with its
individuality, can never match.
However, humans will no longer
be used to propagate our species.
We have learned that
the strong human ego disrupts
the bonds between Ants.
Out of respect for your efforts,
I shall allow humans to permanently
survive within a special zone.
We shall reevaluate the number and
quality of humans to be used as food.
Your lonely battle was not in vain...
I shall not repeat myself again.
Tell me my name.
I am not alone.
Don't underestimate the human race, Meruem.
Meruem... That is your name.
As Netero spoke the King's name,
the King had no time to consider it,
as he watched the old man who was
supposed to be surrendering.
What is this?
Meruem, King of Ants,
you understand nothing...
of humanity's infinite potential for evolution!
It was the first time the King had felt fear.
One look at the face of this beaten old man,
who should have been waiting for death,
made it clear that his seemingly
vain words were no mere boast.
Should your heart stop beating, this will activate.
If there is a hell, I'll see you there.
I see now...
Yes... I see...
You had me in checkmate
from the start...
The bomb was both low-budget and compact,
while also proving surprisingly lethal.
With the right technology,
it was possible to quickly mass
produce these bombs.
Due to the shape of the smoke cloud,
it was called the Miniature Rose,
or the poor man's rose,
and was popular with small dictatorships.
Next time: Hostility x And x Determination.
No matter what happens,
I won't betray my friends.
No matter what happens,
I'll believe in my friends.
Thank you, Chairman Netero.
﻿Don't underestimate the human race, Meruem.
Meruem... That is your name.
What is this?
Meruem, King of Ants,
you understand nothing...
of humanity's infinite potential for evolution!
I see now...
Yes... I see...
You had me in checkmate
from the start...
Hostility x And x Determination
The bomb was both low-budget and compact,
while also proving surprisingly lethal.
With the right technology,
it was possible to quickly mass
produce these bombs.
Due to the shape of the smoke cloud,
it was called the Miniature Rose,
or the poor man's rose,
and was popular with small dictatorships.
In more than 250 countries and regions of the world,
ten times as many roses had bloomed,
consuming 5.12 million human lives.
After terrorists used the bomb in the
center of an adversarial nation's capital,
taking more than 110,000 lives,
an international treaty was signed that
banned the bomb's production.
However, over eighty percent of the
world's countries rejected the proposal
to discard and ban the use of
roses they had already produced,
meaning that hundreds of thousands of seeds
still wait silently in many countries
for their chance to bloom.
"How are humans and Ants different?"
When Netero decided to use his last resort,
could this thought have crossed his mind?
Now, there is no way to find out.
The two immediately understood
what the distant cloud of smoke and
resulting vibration in the air signified.
At the same time,
Pouf's clone found itself looking Knuckle in the eye.
After his experience with Youpi,
Knuckle hoped to reach a
similar understanding with Pouf.
But his faint hopes were quickly shattered.
If the King waves his baton,
the soldiers will become demons if necessary.
Pouf's main body must have learned
that something happened to the King.
That led to the transformation of the clone's
face, revealing the Ants' true nature.
Did the chairman defeat the King?
No, it doesn't matter either way...
In Pouf's face, Knuckle had seen a barrier
that could not be overcome.
It's destroyed!
Is everyone okay?
This is brutal...
It only took them thirty minutes
to wreck the whole place.
That was close...
Ikalgo.
Killua!
Palm...
I see.
But I'm glad to see you.
You returned to us.
Then, as planned, I'll take you to Peijing by car.
No, she wants to stay.
Well, she'll certainly be useful in a fight.
In terms of raw offensive power,
she has me beat...
Probably.
To be honest, I want to go to Gon at once.
However...
I'll wait.
I'll respect his wishes...
His wishes?
He's decided to fight Pitou by himself.
I'll wait right here for one hour.
And once he's made up his mind,
that's it. He won't budge.
In return, he performs his best
when circumstances are as expected.
Which means all we can do is stay out of his way.
B-But what if...
Yeah, I know.
If he gets into serious trouble,
we'll immediately rush in to help him.
I see...
So that's why they're staying behind.
Even if Gon uses all the power he currently has,
he still won't be able to beat Pitou.
In fact, even if the three of us join him,
they're aware that we're still no match for Pitou.
They're staying behind
to die with him!
We're also looking for Knuckle and the others.
Want to come?
Absolutely.
Okay, let's go.
We separated the King and the Royal Guard
to let the chairman defeat the King.
As Knov-san said, we've completed
the mission we were assigned.
Each of us will have to decide
where we go from here.
Do we stop or keep going?
I am
going to keep fighting them.
I've already laid down my life here more than once.
Even if we can't reach an understanding,
I won't give up until I'm content with the outcome.
You're finished.
Why did he say that?
There's still time left...
Did he notice that my surgery was done?
I made sure to hide my progress from him.
But if I showed any sign of
relaxing after finishing it,
and he noticed that...
I must kill him.
No matter the cost!
I must kill him...
For the King's sake!
Did he notice my bloodlust then?
Stand up.
We move to Peijing now.
Running is faster for us.
What happened to me?
I would like to—
The next time you try to delay me, I'll kill her.
S-Sorry!
Am I interrupting something?
U-Um, I don't understand what's going on...
I understand.
Let's go.
Pitou was close enough to take
off his head with one arm.
But Pitou couldn't move.
After seeing how sharp Gon's senses were,
Pitou's instincts said to obey.
I can't make a move now...
My chance will come.
There'll be many, on our way to Peijing.
But I must get Komugi to the King!
Gon, want me to use Chapter 7
Bankruptcy on Pitou?
If there's an escape attempt,
I can track Pitou down.
And if Pitou tries to fight back,
APR will protect you.
Thank you, Knuckle.
But it's okay.
I trust Pitou...
So until Pitou and I have met with Kite,
keep an eye on her.
A-Are you talking about me?
Is he going to use Komugi...
As a hostage?!
Once Pitou turns Kite back, we'll let her go.
I'm sure you're also willing to trust me, right?
Pitou?
You sure about this, Killua?
You aren't going with Gon?
We were...
No, Killua was prepared to die with Gon.
But Gon didn't want him to come!
Pitou and I will go by ourselves.
It's okay.
That was always the plan.
And I feel better after hearing what he's doing.
You mean the hostage?
Yeah. The real danger would be if I went along,
and Pitou managed to capture me.
Then Pitou would have the option
to exchange hostages.
Seriously...
What have they been through for
their minds to work this way?
It's all right.
Now that I've seen Gon with these eyes,
I'll know immediately if something happens.
Besides, Pitou won't abandon her.
Which means that Gon is safe.
I can't understand what's going on.
Where is the Supreme Leader?
Who are these people?
The heat of the explosion had
melted the rock into magma,
leaving a scene resembling the
mouth of an active volcano,
producing a perpetual cloud of black smoke
that prevented the living from entering.
Pouf!
I'll search inside, so I need you to
search the surrounding area.
It's possible that the explosion
sent the King flying.
I was wrong...
We will kill them all, with the King at our side.
None will be spared!
Your Majesty!
Youpi's roar had an ominous tone.
Before he could even see the truth for himself,
tears were already streaming down Pouf's face.
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
Next time:
Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.
I never ask for anything in return.
Isn't that unconditional love?
Unparalleled joy.
﻿With the detonation of Miniature Rose,
the bomb activated by the stopping of his heart,
Netero perished with the King.
Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love
Your Majesty!
He's breathing!
But damn it...
We must hurry... Or it'll
be too late for the King!
And there isn't time to take him to Pitou!
It will be fine...
I will save the King.
How?
I will feed myself to him...
That's all there is to it.
Come, my cells!
Diffuse throughout the King and heal him!
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty...
Are you all right?
How do you feel?
This exquisite taste...
I feel as though I am breathing the air of paradise.
My strength is returning...
This is a fairy mist.
I am...
I am not worthy of such praise!
I am happy to hear that.
Please feast to your heart's content.
There is plenty here.
I crave it...
Now that I have experienced this taste,
I cannot eat anything else...
Your Majesty...
Your Majesty, Your Majesty, Your Majesty!
Please stop taking me to the heights
of heaven's bliss with your praise!
No more!
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
You may also feed on this.
He's liquefying his cells.
You thought this through, Youpi.
It's so powerful and rich...
Surely, this comes from the heavens.
Drops of angels themselves...
Your Majesty!
There is no way to compare the two.
All I can say is that I have never
tasted better...
Not enough...
I need more.
Bring me as much as you can of both...
Yes!
My King!
With pleasure!
Supreme bliss...
Unparalleled joy.
What is this?
What is this feeling?
From now on, call me Meruem...
That is the name my mother gave me.
I see...
So this is...
...unconditional love!
Having witnessed an absolute
being's death and rebirth,
and having shared their own beings with the King,
Pouf and Youpi had at last reached
the pinnacle of their species...
The level of Queen.
It's clear that his strength has increased.
He's even stronger now!
Our bodies have helped the King...
And become part of him.
What an honor... What bliss!
The King's heartbeat! The King's warmth!
We even share the King's thoughts!
However...
That is why we know...
The King is currently...
...confused.
Your Majesty!
M-Meruem-sama...
How do you feel?
Should we return to the palace first?
If you wish for more of that food,
we can provide it.
In a few minutes, my clones will arrive.
Food...
Ah...
Then that taste was real.
As I wandered through the light,
I heard someone call my name.
Calling, "Meruem."
I do not know if that was a dream or reality.
I cannot remember why
I am here.
Meruem-sama...
You've lost your memory?
I feel fine.
In fact, I am brimming with energy.
But my mind is hazy...
Why have your appearances changed?
We sent our clones to scout the area.
They are searching for remaining
enemies to dispose of—
You may have my best interests in mind.
But when you lie to me, you betray me.
You will not get a second chance.
So, I was eating you.
We offered ourselves to you!
We know we acted beyond our places!
But we made the decision!
What happened? Give me an explanation.
Before we can do that,
I must ask you one question.
It appears that you recall
our former appearances.
Do you remember the day
we first began serving you?
I do not.
I recognized that you were my
Royal Guards Pouf and Youpi
the moment I saw you.
No, I should say I remembered that you were.
However, I cannot recall anything
about how that came to be.
Meruem-sama...
I believe you are suffering from temporary
memory loss due to the explosion.
Explosion?
Yes.
You came here to engage
in a duel with the enemy.
However, the cowardly human
resorted to the underhanded
trick of using a powerful bomb,
betraying your honorable intentions!
A duel...
Yes...
I was
fighting a duel.
We knew that, given your power and fortune,
a mere human weapon could
never deal a lethal blow.
However, we could not bear
to see you in that state.
So we did what we could to speed your recovery,
knowing full well that we might be punished.
Our bodies have always been yours.
We were simply returning them to you.
Let's return to the palace!
That will be the fastest way
for you to regain your memory!
This is
my perfect
chance!
If I return to the palace first,
I can dispose of her!
At the moment, the King does not remember her.
If I eliminate her now,
he will never have the chance to remember her!
This will require...
Convincing Pitou?
Getting rid of that meddling human?
No...
The first thing to do
is to end her life.
If I kill her, everything else will fall into place.
The King will need twenty
minutes to reach the palace,
and that is if he runs at full speed.
I have enough time to kill her.
This feels as natural as though
I was born with these.
I will learn to fly in no time.
Which way to the palace?
North.
You should be able to make
it in fifteen minutes!
It's there.
The answer I seek is in the palace.
He is fast!
If I waste too much time, he'll catch up!
Fifteen minutes?
No, at this speed, he'll arrive in five minutes...
I have but two to three minutes.
Quickly, my clones!
This is a gamble.
Once the King sees the millions
of humans outside the palace,
he will remember everything!
Remember that his objective
is to rule all living creatures!
So long as he doesn't see that woman!
As a Royal Guard...
As one who has inherited the Queen's will...
I must eliminate that lowly human girl!
She's gone!
Where is she?
Chapter 7 Bankruptcy!
I've seen you once before.
Before I was placed in the cocoon.
So I can see you, no matter where you are.
Wink Blue: Lonesome Deep Sea Fish
What?
What just attacked my clone?
It came from nowhere.
Pouf, what is that?
I don't know.
It seems to have resulted from the
remaining enemies attacking my clone.
We must hurry.
The King!
The King is alive.
Next time:
Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.
You know how people say "like" all the time?
Sure.
So wouldn't it be a, like, "Formidable-like
Enemy x And x Clear-like Objective"-like thing?
Uh...
﻿The revived King, now calling himself Meruem,
carried Pouf and Youpi back to the palace
in order to recover his memories.
Pouf's main body is with the King!
They're heading toward the palace
at an alarming speed.
That probably means the chairman lost.
What can the rest of us do?
Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective
What's happening?
Where is the Supreme Leader?
It won't stop following us.
That's annoying.
It's the enemy's power.
I believe it won't disappear until we've damaged
the enemy's physical body.
Ah, how interesting.
I shall test it.
Incredible, that's my...
I understand.
My power was not meant for me.
It was meant to be used by the King!
Youpi.
This does not make sense.
If you knew this power resulted
from an enemy's attack,
that means either you saw it used,
or it was used on you.
Which was it?
I was hit by an attack.
I cannot see it following you now.
So why does the enemy still live?
How did you free yourself
from the enemy's power?
Answer me.
We made an agreement.
In exchange for releasing me from his power,
I agreed to spare his comrade.
Then, after he released you,
you had the opportunity to finish
him off along with his comrade.
Why did you not do so?
Honestly, I'm not sure.
I believe I felt that, if I had,
I would have lost in some way.
I felt that breaking a promise,
even a promise to an enemy,
would be equivalent to conceding defeat.
Impossible!
You're saying that your personal emotions
were the reason you spared the lives
of those who oppose the King?
I'm prepared to accept any punishment...
I have no excuses to offer.
I only ordered that you not lie to me.
I have no reason to punish
those who speak the truth.
Pouf.
Yes!
Youpi.
Yes!
We have all obtained rather inconvenient bodies.
Our bodies and souls have been linked...
It is no longer possible for the three of
us to hide anything from one another!
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty...
Let us go.
Yes!
Your Majesty...
Was that meant as a final warning
because you realize what I plan to do,
and the guilt it makes me feel?
Nevertheless!
Even if it means I am executed for my crime...
I do this for the King!
Where is she? Find her!
Hurry up and find her!
For the sake of our species!
Where is she?
Find her!
She is not necessary!
Find her, quickly!
I do this for the King.
Is she over there?
Wait! Not there!
No! That way!
Hey!
When you're split up, you can't hurt me.
You're ignoring me?
Wait up!
You can't remove APR without defeating me!
Youpi, the enemy suddenly appeared before me.
Does the enemy who attached this
also have the ability to teleport?
That's someone else...
There's one who can make himself
and those around him invisible.
He looks like a chameleon.
I don't know his name, but he's
one of the Squadron Leaders.
Which means he's a traitor!
So you spared not only humans,
but a traitor, as well?
I'm willing to accept any punishment.
Your Majesty!
Until we've defeated them, please...
I do not care. It is irrelevant.
On the contrary, I believe that this is a trial
that Chimera Ants must overcome to evolve.
Youpi...
We must accept your emotional instability,
as well as the traitor's betrayal,
as we move forward.
Humans are a sacrifice meant to help
us attain the next level of evolution.
The perfect sacrifice.
Once we arrive at the pinnacle of evolution,
any lingering traces of the human ego will
be nothing more than a minor wild-card trait.
The King's opinion had completely
reversed following the explosion.
Was it due to the impact?
No.
This was the King, as well.
If the enemy can become invisible,
I can find him by making contact.
I need to split myself
into the smallest clones
that can still retain sight,
and expand the search!
Bastard...
Clearly, I'm not his target.
He turned back just like that... Who is he after?
Is he looking for the traitor, Meleoron?
That's bad, then!
I can't think of any way to defeat the
King without Meleoron's ability...
I must protect Meleoron at any cost!
Pouf divided his clones to the point where
they're too small for me to see.
Unlike his main body, his clones have to be
at full size for me to see them.
The man with the pompadour
was obviously just a decoy.
They must know we've realized
that the chameleon is a traitor.
In other words, they believe that I've
returned to dispose of the traitor.
Assuming the chameleon is concealing
himself and the others as they flee,
and that the woman is among them,
if I get close, they will protect the
chameleon and abandon her!
Because they believe the
chameleon is my target.
They must have never imagined that I'd return
to kill the woman that Pitou was
trying so desperately to heal.
If they believe I've returned to rescue
the woman, it's even better!
They may even offer to hand her
over to me with conditions.
He must be after Meleoron.
Since, from their perspective, he's a traitor.
Hold on.
Let's make sure.
The door leading underground?
So that's it...
They realized that I know they
can become invisible,
and decided to give me two options.
The chameleon either ran inside
or fled somewhere else.
Their plan is to split up my clones
further, to weaken me.
No! Over there! Over there!
Over there! Over there! Over there!
What?
They're giving me two options.
But they're to pursue the traitor or the woman?
Then they want to know which is my target?
Do I split up my clones, to hide my objective?
Or do I send the majority of them after
the chameleon, to fool them?
Even if the shutter is closed,
I can slip through it if my clones are particle-sized.
No, I don't have time for that!
I'll go after
the woman!
So she's his target?
I only have to kill the woman
and hide her body from the
King for a short time.
My clone can manage that!
I only need a minute or two!
He's...
incredibly fast!
Then she's your target?
I'm up for a game of tag.
I can go all night.
Judging by how quickly he reacted,
it would be hard to catch him,
even at full strength.
If I don't hurry, the King will arrive.
What do I do?
Out of options, Pouf arrived at a diabolical solution.
I know!
The greatest magic of all...
He split himself up?
But he won't be big enough to take her away!
Is he going to attack me first?
Your plan is going to backfire...
You've reduced your speed and power,
so I don't even need to use Godspeed.
Cease this futile resistance.
Your plans have already been thwarted!
What is the point in adding
to your transgressions?
If it is fear of retribution driving
you to flee, you needn't worry.
The King will forgive you.
He is a benevolent ruler.
Don't make me laugh!
You think I'll believe that?
You'll probably tie me to a tree,
and turn me into a soldier!
The King?
That's right...
Keep running.
Take her far from the King first!
That confirms it...
I don't know the reason,
but this girl is important to the King.
For Gon... For the sake of our mission...
I can't let the enemy have her!
That's right...
The person chasing us sounded like
one of the people with the Supreme Leader...
Does that mean the King is the Supreme Leader?
Then who is this person?
Who are the people he was with?
Your twisted sense of justice
will never help the people!
First, I cast a spell on the woman.
I use magic words to make her suspicious...
The King and I seek open dialogue.
Now, release her at once!
Bastard... That's just a bunch of baloney.
What is he up to?
Let me go...
Please put me down!
Something's wrong with you!
You're all tingly!
What are you talking about, fool?
I'm trying to save you!
You're lying!
I'm lying?
You trust that insect more than you trust me?
Insect?
What are you talking about?!
That's right... She can't see!
Let go! Let me go!
That'll make it hard to explain.
Damn... Almost.
It didn't take long for the poison to kick in.
If the woman you're carrying resists,
your speed will also fall...
What's going on?
He wasn't aiming for me...
He was aiming for the woman.
He was trying to kill her!
If she escapes, that's fine.
If she distracts him with her resistance,
allowing me to kill her, even better!
Komugi-san!
The enemies consider you a valuable hostage.
They will not kill you...
Keep struggling!
Keep fighting back!
I'll save you soon!
She was knocked out, so that's impossible.
Well, I have no idea what's going on here,
but I know that you're making me mad.
If you enter this ring,
I'll kill you.
You may be a clone,
but you were formed from the original's cells.
If I burn those cells, they die.
Electricity...
Come on... I'll whittle you down.
Are you having difficulty?
I can feel your impatience.
I shall lend you a hand.
It's nothing you need to worry about.
Your first priority should be regaining
your memories, Meruem-sama.
Once my main body has returned,
I can deal with the intruders easily.
Anyway... Behold, Meruem-sama!
Humans, as far as we can see!
Do you remember now?
They are all here for you...
They all belong to you!
They belong to me?
You will rule these dumb, inferior creatures,
and stand atop the food chain.
That is your glorious destiny!
As willed by the heavens!
Something isn't right...
There's still something else...
Something else I've forgotten.
What are you saying?
Nothing could be more important
than ruling over all life forms...
I suppose.
Perhaps the explosion has left me confused.
However...
The pain won't cease.
Why is the palace in shambles?
It was destroyed in the battle.
It happened after you left the palace.
Where is the place I spent most of my time in?
It has been completely destroyed...
I suppose I should look at what's left.
Yes, you may find something that will
help you regain your memories...
This is bad!
That could be it...
The Gungi board and pieces!
They may be the key to awakening his memory!
I must dispose of them!
He gave up?
Over there.
Let's go.
Next time: Magic x Of x Despair.
Killua, thanks.
What's this about?
We're buddies, right?
Yeah, but still...
Thanks.
﻿Damn... Almost.
It didn't take long for the poison to kick in.
What's going on?
He wasn't aiming for me...
He was aiming for the woman.
He was trying to kill her!
Magic x Of x Despair
He's back.
The King has returned.
Hey, aren't we too close?
It's okay...
We aren't close enough to trigger APR's timer.
The problem will be when
the King and Pouf split up.
Should I remove APR from Pouf,
and use it on the King?
These are known as human grapes.
The humans fit to become
soldiers wait here to hatch.
Hurry!
Hurry!
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster!
There it is.
Hide it fast.
Hurry! Hurry!
Faster! Faster!
Faster! Faster!
Hurry! Hurry!
Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster!
Hurry! Hurry!
We must also hurry!
Where is Welfin?
These won't work.
When the bodies are ripped apart,
I can't use Living Dead Dolls.
Killua...
The King has arrived at the palace's entrance!
Yeah.
We should circle around, following the wall,
and hide in the crowd.
Okay.
What about Gon and Pitou?
They just entered the Peijing hiding place.
They're walking down a hallway.
How does that crystal work now?
You can also see Pouf and me in it?
Yes, looking from a bit above.
Wink Blue uses my crystal ball
to remember people seen through my right eye.
Looking through only my left eye,
I can watch those people's current
positions in the crystal ball.
At the moment, the crystal ball
is simultaneously showing
Gon and Pitou, Killua and me,
as well as Pouf, the King, and Youpi.
It's like watching a TV screen
that's been split up.
However, my right eye has only
seen Pouf, you, and Gon.
So I can only see the others when
they're around one of you.
And I can only use my power to
watch three people at once.
If I see someone else with my right eye,
I won't be able to see the oldest
of the three targets, Pouf.
I'm not sure you need to keep watching Pouf.
If you can only see his main body,
and his clones are scattered,
it's probably more a minus than a plus.
Is that so?
If I can only see his main body,
that also means I won't be fooled by clones.
And if his main body is only the size
of a fly, I can literally crush him.
Our chance to defeat Pouf is while he's divided.
What greater plus is there?
So they figured me out.
Then I just need to use that against them.
Walk forward.
It's the right door, at the end.
Even with all the noise echoing in the old castle,
Pitou's hearing was sharp
enough to pick up the voice
on a cell phone hidden in a pocket.
Pitou-sama, this is Welfin.
I will keep this as brief as I can.
Brovada and I have retaken the girl.
Intruders are still around,
so we're taking refuge beneath the palace.
I will let you hear her voice.
Hello? Pitou-sama?
This is Komugi.
I'm fine, so don't worry.
Got it...
Goodbye.
Was that good?
Yes.
If possible,
can you get me a doctor, Pouf-dono?
It's him, right?
Since I can split myself at the cellular level,
I can also become different people.
I can replicate faces, bodies, even voices.
Now, Pitou is also under my spell...
The spell of the lie that will
free Pitou from that curse.
So, keep watching Gon and Pitou.
You should see something interesting soon...
Now, heal Kite, like you promised.
Once that's done, I'll release her.
Your name...
What is your name?
Gon.
Gon Freecss.
Gon...
You listened to my request.
So I will be honest with you.
He is
already
dead.
Dead?
He died during our fight.
I remember now.
Back then, you were...
I was unable to revive one who was dead.
My power could only prevent
the body from decomposing,
and control its movements.
His soul is no longer here.
There is no way to heal him.
I am sorry.
Palm...
Yes?
Thank you.
What? What's this?
What are you thanking me for?
Stuff...
Stuff? Such as?
Drop it! Stuff just means stuff!
What was that?
It seems wrong to make me mad
while you're thanking me!
Don't worry... I'll never say thanks again.
Because now we're friends.
I never say thanks to my friends.
Anyway, how's Gon?
Y-Yes, that's right...
What's wrong?
It can't be...
What's going on?!
Kite...
Kite is...
dead.
Man, forced to take another life...
You've grown, Gon.
If I...
If I...
Whether we win or lose,
hell lies ahead of us.
If I hadn't gone with him...
Kite wouldn't have died.
It was...
It was my fault.
It was because I tagged along...
It was really my fault...
Get away from me!
It's my fault that Kite is...
No... It isn't my fault!
Pitou's the one who killed him!
Not me!
But it was me...
It was me....
I killed Kite.
It's my fault...
No! It's Pitou's fault!
But it's really my fault.
Kite is alive!
He wouldn't ever let that thing beat him!
Kite is dead...
Kite is dead.
Kite is dead.
Kite is dead...
Kite is dead!
Help...
Someone help...
Kite is... Kite is...
Kite is... Kite is...
Kite...
Just wait a little longer.
I'll get you back to normal soon.
I can't get him back to normal.
Kite is gone...
It's my fault.
Someone help...
Someone help Kite—
No! No! No! No! No!
But... But...
But...
But... But... But... But...
But...
Doctor Blythe.
What?
Pitou's going to help Kite?
Oh, it's true...
Kite being dead was a lie.
Pitou will heal him.
Huh?
Why is it healing Pitou's arm?
Turn Kite back to normal.
Please...
After you finish what you're doing.
Why? What's going on?!
What's wrong? What happened, Palm?
I don't know...
I can only see what's happening...
But something is wrong with Gon!
What's wrong?!
Pitou is healing itself, not Kite.
Gon is slumped on the floor next to Pitou.
Impossible...
As long as she's in our hands, Pitou...
Pitou has to obey us!
Please...
Help Kite.
Next time: Anger x And x Light.
Hold on until I get there!
I don't care if this is the end...
I'll kill you, Pitou!
Gon!
﻿Hello? Pitou-sama?
This is Komugi.
I'm fine, so don't worry.
Got it...
Now, Pitou is also under my spell...
The spell of the lie that will
free Pitou from that curse.
Gon...
You listened to my request.
So I will be honest with you.
He is
already
dead.
His soul is no longer here.
There is no way to heal him.
I am sorry.
Huh?
Why is it healing Pitou's arm?
Turn Kite back to normal.
Please...
After you finish what you're doing...
Anger x And x Light
The tables have been turned.
Pitou believes we have recovered Komugi.
The way things are looking,
that Gon boy will be killed.
I am the only one who can stop Pitou.
If you hand the woman over
to me, I will stop Pitou...
Get lost, scumbag!
Leave her to me.
I swear upon these eyes that
I will not let them have her.
Yeah, I'm counting on you.
Speed of Lightning!
Gon...
Wait for me to get there!
Gon...
I'm sorry to say this,
but I must kill you.
For the King.
You must
kill me?
You aren't going to heal him?
Then you really aren't
going to heal Kite...
Liar.
What?
What is this?
I don't care
if this is the end...
So...
I'll use everything.
I was right.
His power is now equal
to that of the King!
I'll kill you,
Pitou!
Terpsichora!
Exceed your limits,
and dance!
I must stop him here!
It can't be!
Is he heading for the King?
Come.
I don't want to destroy this place.
This way.
Follow me.
I don't know how he did it,
but he's forced his body to mature to a point
at which he's able to defeat me.
First comes
rock...
Rock.
Paper.
Rock.
Sinking deeply into unconsciousness,
Pitou felt a sense of relief.
Thank goodness...
This power could only be achieved through
the sacrifice of his own life energy.
He's prepared to never use Nen again.
That was the resolve required
to perform this feat.
An enemy blessed with immense talent
has been forced to exchange all
of that talent for this power.
I'm so glad
I am the one
that he will kill...
Having used Speed of Lightning to race
to Gon, Killua arrived to hear...
Which one of them is doing that?
Gon!
And what he found was...
A silhouette that looked nothing
like the person he'd known,
swinging a fist, bloodied from countless punches,
downward toward the skull
of an already-broken Pitou...
Rock.
Paper.
...for the final, shattering blow.
Kite...
I finished the job, the way you taught me to.
So...
Gon,
is that you?
Killua...
Having seen Gon's appearance,
Killua immediately thought of Bisky.
But he realized the difference at once.
Bisky's appearance changed,
but there wasn't a massive increase
in the aura contained within her.
And in Bisky's case,
she was merely reverting to her original form.
But Gon's done the opposite!
How many years?
More than ten?
Decades?
This would have been the result
of years of endless training.
What price did he have to pay
to obtain so much aura?
Pitou's devotion to the King was so great
that even after death, Terpsichora clad
itself in even more powerful Nen,
transforming Pitou into a corpse puppet
ready to leap forward in pursuit of its prey,
its sole purpose to kill Gon.
In that fraction of a second,
shorter than the blink of an eye,
Killua heard Gon speak.
It's okay.
It doesn't hurt.
I'm not trying to be tough.
I'm kind of happy...
I finally
get to be the same
as Kite was then.
Gon...
I feel like
I've been redeemed some.
You can have my right arm.
First comes rock...
Gon!
It's time for you
to sleep, too.
Stop...
You can't!
If you keep using this power,
what will happen to you?
Rock.
Paper.
Gon!
Next time: Flash x And x Start.
I never got a chance to say this, but thank you...
For everything.
﻿As Gon was dedicating all of his
power to finishing off Neferpitou,
Meruem, Pouf, and Youpi were
inside the west tower, where Komugi had been.
Once we're through here...
The west tower's second floor.
Once we've passed this area,
the King will never remember her!
As long as I don't give him
an opportunity to see her...
Flash x And x Start
Something is missing...
But what is it?
I don't know.
I know...
I won't say anything.
I agree that we shouldn't let the King see her.
Ideally, he should stay as he is now.
I have
a feeling that something is
missing from this place.
Though it may just be a side
effect of my memory loss.
Exactly...
Your memory can be verified
through what you see.
Which means you can recover all
of the memories you need.
I believe the selection was to begin at 12:00.
Yes.
However, that can be moved up.
By 9:00,
the remaining humans will be gathered
in the plain before the palace.
What is it?
I have not used my scales
on the humans still on their way in.
We don't want them to cause a commotion,
so I will summon my clones to hypnotize them.
What will you do, Youpi?
Right...
I'll look for Pitou.
Right now, I don't have the
strength to protect you.
Pitou...
Did you just remember something?
Oh, yeah... We haven't told
the King about Pitou yet.
Meruem-sama, do you remember who Pitou is?
Yes,
one of my three Royal Guards.
I can recall Pitou's appearance so clearly,
it seems a mystery that I
didn't remember it until now.
So words can also trigger his memory,
not just images...
We cannot let him hear her name.
We must be very careful...
The key will be convincing Pitou.
I know...
Tell Pitou to keep quiet, right?
There it is again...
I'm counting on you.
Yes...
I...
asked Pitou
to do something for me.
Youpi.
Yes...
Bring Pitou to me at once.
Yes.
What will you do, Meruem-sama?
Enemies are still around.
Indeed...
As I search for Pitou myself,
I shall hunt down the remaining intruders.
This is bad!
Your Majesty, that would be...
It is merely for entertainment.
And I am sure these enemies
have useful information.
However, we won't be at your side,
and we don't know what enemies remainâ€”
I want an honest answer,
Pouf.
Do you believe there is a chance
that these intruders could get the better of me?!
No...
Absolutely not.
Th-This exceeds my expectations...
The King...
Meruem-sama...
is the ultimate being.
That much is certain!
The overwhelming aura
left Knuckle and the rest, still concealed,
in total despair.
Th-This isn't something we can deal with...
To handle this, you'd need an entire
nation's military might.
Meleoron, we're making a run for it!
Seriously?
You bet!
We'll head back to Peijing under
the cover of this crowd!
What about Killua, Ikalgo, and the others?
There's nothing we can do!
If they can see that, they'll understand.
They'll run away, too.
That's the only option.
That isn't...
something we can handle.
But if you and I team up...
We could land one attack, sure.
And we could probably attach APR.
But...
APR only adds interest if I'm within fifty meters!
If we're within fifty meters of him...
Do you think we'd last long
enough for him to go bust?
You'd have to have lungs as strong as the boss's!
The situation's changed...
The enemy knows about our powers!
They can prepare for us.
I was an idiot.
We needed to notify the Association
right away of the chairman's defeat,
so they could immediately initiate
the next plan of action.
Hurry!
Revenge and duty...
The difference in motivations
between Meleoron and Knuckle
placed growing distance between
them as they walked.
At that moment...
Meruem's En lit up the palace and the
surrounding area in a literal flash.
Sensing there were two enemies nearby,
he began with Knuckle.
Next was Meleoron, who had barely thought
that he should activate his power
when he was knocked out.
Where's the King?
It disappeared!
I shall be interrogating them.
Once I am done, do as you like.
There were two other Nen users whose aura
reacted to my En.
One of them must be carrying
the unconscious Komugi.
What do I do? What do I do?
I must stop the King...
Your Majesty!
If your purpose is entertainment,
shouldn't you take your time?
It appears
that you have a proposal.
Yes... Would you be willing
to engage in a contest with us?
A contest?
Again...
A contest...
A contest...
A contest...
A contest...
What contest?
Youpi and I will search for Pitou,
while you search for the
two remaining Nen users.
A contest to see who locates their target first?
Yes.
But don't you need to go and spread scales?
Correct.
So while I hypnotize the remaining humans,
I would request that Meruem-sama wait here.
It is very clear
that the difference in power between you
and the intruders is insurmountable.
Finding and capturing them should
only take you a few seconds.
That cannot be called entertainment.
Meanwhile, we must find Pitou,
who has engaged an enemy that
seems capable of teleportation.
And Pitou's current location is unknown.
To make up for the difference,
we request additional time,
as well as one further handicap.
One further handicap?
What is it?
You are only allowed to use En once more.
How does that sound?
Amusing.
I accept this contest.
Thank you very much.
Perfect...
I can use the extra time to kill that woman!
As long as we are playing,
I have a proposal, as well.
If you win, I shall grant each of you a wish.
Yes, sir.
We are very honored.
And what if you win, Meruem-sama?
If I win,
you will tell me what you are hiding from me.
Your Majesty...
Silence.
I already told you...
You and I are united as one.
Did you think that I could not sense
the guilt that you now feel?
However, I sense that your feelings
of loyalty are stronger.
Otherwise, I would have sent
your heads flying long ago.
I am certain you have your reasons.
I shall not ask them...
Assuming that you beat me.
You will obtain what you desire,
and protect your secret.
You could not wish for better terms...
Assuming that you beat me.
Meruem-sama...
I shall immediately begin to spread
scales, and not waste a moment.
If we lose, we will tell you everything.
I swear it on my life.
You do not appear to be treating
this as mere entertainment.
Once Pouf finishes spreading his
scales and returns, I shall begin.
Is that acceptable?
Yes.
Victory goes to whomever returns to
this room with their target first.
If Pitou should return,
you are to explain the objective of this contest
and order Pitou to hide.
As you wish.
I shall tell you that
the two Nen users my En registered
were an octopus and a human
carrying some sort of burden.
I must win.
No, victory is already assured!
The question is what to do
about Pitou and the woman.
Then...
Start!
Where do you think Pitou went?
It'll be fine! Pitou should return soon!
Turn around and wait by the west
tower for Pitou's return.
Do not allow Pitou near the King!
You can't use clones while you
spread your scales, right?
Then you aren't buying us any time.
Trust me!
I'm begging you!
Unbelievable... Such tremendous aura...
Those two are dead.
No,
they're still alive.
They were only knocked unconscious...
Where's Gon?
Killua's carrying him...
His hair is long?
Is it someone else?
No, those are the only two
figures in my crystal ball.
That is Gon!
Something must have happened
when I wasn't watching.
Where's Pitou?
In any case, don't come back here... Please!
Pouf is spreading scales on the citizens...
Are they poisonous?
It would help me more if he'd stay near the King.
In any case, he's on the palace's opposite side.
I must get as far from my
previous location as I can...
After that En wave, I immediately used Wink Blue,
and the King appeared next to Pouf,
carrying Knuckle and Meleoron.
Only a few seconds had passed!
Next, he will pursue Ikalgo or me.
The King could be standing behind
me at any moment...
I must hurry and get farther away...
Before the King uses En again!
I must go in there!
If I'm crossing the plain when he uses En, I won't be able to escape!
If I'm deep underground,
perhaps his En won't reach.
But I'm also trapping myself.
Should I escape outside the palace,
and hope that the King doesn't
make a move for a while?
There's no reason to expect him not to!
What should I do?
What is the right decision?
Ikalgo!
I thought you might come here...
Let's go in! Hurry!
Yes, but...
Hurry!
Isn't that why you came here?
If he uses En again, we're finished!
Where's Killua?
He went after Gon.
They're together now.
I don't know what happened to Pitou.
I see...
So Meleoron and Knuckle were captured.
The King is on a whole other level.
Why do you think their lives were spared?
Um, well...
It's possible that I just want
to think that they're alive...
They're alive.
Probably so they can be exchanged.
You mean the way Killua discussed
exchanging hostages?
I'll set a trap...
I'm not going out without a fight.
First, we'll hide the girl in Bizeff's room!
A contest...
A contest...
Next time: Deadline x To x Live.
Killua...
Don't you dare speak his name!
You would never understand!
Killua!
﻿After challenging Meruem to a
contest in order to buy time,
Pouf was now scattering scales on the
citizens who were not yet hypnotized.
I must hurry or Meruem-sama
will remember that woman...
We haven't moved forward at all.
What's going on up ahead?
Shh, no talking!
What are you talking about?
The soldiers are held up in the back.
I heard all their commanders have
collapsed, one after another...
Like puppets whose strings have been cut.
There haven't been any warnings
about stepping out of line anymore.
I keep hearing loud noises
coming from the palace...
Something is weird!
Maybe...
It's a coup d'état?
After giving the King 6/7 of my body,
I've lost a lot of my power.
The scales aren't scattering well.
And I don't see any of Pitou's puppets.
Does it mean the battle with the boy is so intense,
Pitou cannot spare energy on puppets?
The boy didn't look to be that strong.
I cannot use my clones while
I'm scattering my scales.
But I need to hurry and kill the woman.
Whatever it takes...
This is my final chance!
Deadline x To x Live
Palm, take the four women still here with you.
They didn't run away?
No.
Use duct tape to bind their
hands and cover their eyes.
If they see me, it'll take too long to explain.
That's true... I understand.
Why did we put them on the truck, anyway?
A messenger?
You just have to tell the King or the Royal Guard
that the woman is in the underground warehouse.
Let them know that we're looking to negotiate.
Once that's done, you're free.
It's probably a trap, right?
That's what I'll tell the King.
If I don't, it'll look unnatural, and he'll suspect me.
Yeah.
Wait... Just the fact that I'm doing the
enemy's bidding may anger the King.
I'm not gonna dig my own grave.
Fine, I'll try it.
Can you drive?
Better than you.
It's important that he carries out his mission.
Perhaps I should keep an eye on him,
even if it means losing Pouf...
Palm.
It's okay.
Welfin,
once this is over, you're free.
Go and see Gyro.
Don't get too cocky!
I'll kill you!
Don't you dare speak his name!
You would never understand!
I understand, Zaikahal.
How...
How do you know
my former...
I didn't tell anyone.
I probably won't ever remember my former name,
but we were buddies.
Buddies?
Before we were Ants.
They're our enemies.
Enemies of NGL.
Am I wrong?
Brovada has forgotten his past,
but he was also one of us.
Take him with you.
Ikalgo...
How do you know?
What do you mean?
You told me to go see Gyro.
You'd only say that if you knew Gyro was alive.
Yeah, that's true.
But...
I don't know that he's alive.
I just can't believe otherwise.
Since we all "survived."
He couldn't have just been digested.
Damn it... Damn it!
Damn it!
Are you sure about this, Pouf?
Ten minutes have passed, and I don't
see any sign of Pitou returning...
Get out.
Remove your bonds and use a truck to escape.
Once you're outside, you'll understand
the current situation.
I hate to admit it...
But Ikalgo's right.
Killing Gyro wouldn't be enough to stop him.
Which means they're the enemy.
I owe him for giving me a wake-up call.
I'll be his messenger!
Stop!
Youpi-dono?
I already found a Royal Guard.
Youpi-dono...
I have a message that must be
taken to the King immediately.
The underground warehouse?
Yes.
And they're looking to exchange
the woman for their allies that
have been taken hostage?
Yes.
Please tell the King at once.
Got it... I'm on it.
Right...
We're having a contest, so I
don't need to tell the King.
If Pouf was anticipating this, he's a smart one.
You can go.
Yes, sir.
Once he's back, I need to tell Pouf.
Still, what's Pitou doing right now?
Chimera Ants are the enemy.
Gyro's enemy...
Our enemy!
Youpi-dono!
I have a question!
What is it?
Do you have any memories of your former life?
Memories from before you
became a Chimera Ant?
No, of course not.
I am the Royal Guard Youpi.
I've never been anyone else.
Don't ask me stupid questions!
Youpi-dono...
Hey! That's enough—
If you attack me, I'll fight back.
I have a few questions for you.
You have five seconds to answer.
Don't get too cocky, you little punk!
Contest...
Contest...
Something is missing...
Marshal
Marshal
Marshal
Yes...
I was
battling someone.
Someone
that I have yet to defeat
a single time...
That took much longer than expected.
By now, Pitou must have returned...
I hope the King hasn't grown impatient.
Where's Youpi?
Where has Youpi gone?
What's that?
Youpi?
I-It can't be...
We're okay now...
What do you mean, Palm?
King! Meruem-sama!
Youpi has been killed.
There are still skilled enemies around!
Where's Pitou?
Oh, Pitou hasn't returned...
Then...
I can now begin, yes?
W-Wait, Meruem-sama!
The situation has changed...
It's too dangerous! The contest is—
The contest is off?
That means I have won.
Tell me everything you know.
Is that acceptable?
We're okay now?
What do you mean, Palm?
Killua deduced that she is special to the King.
But the Royal Guard is divided...
That is because
Pitou tried to save and protect her,
while Pouf tried to kill her.
In other words,
she is a double-edged sword for the King.
Wait, wait, wait, wait...
I find that hard to believe.
It's impossible
for the Royal Guard to bicker
and defy the King's will!
Is it?
Then why are you and I here now?
Wouldn't you say it's impossible for Soldier Ants
to side with humans?
Adding humans to the gene pool
has led to many events that would be
impossible for normal Chimera Ants.
Can you be certain that I'm wrong?
Sorry...
My point is that
the division among the Royal Guard
may not necessarily contradict
their loyalty to the King.
There is a human that the
King cares deeply about.
"We must protect that human."
"We must kill that human."
Both reactions make sense.
For now, I'll concede that point to you.
Why does that mean we're okay now?
Twenty minutes have passed
since the initial wave of En.
But the King hasn't killed or captured us yet.
I don't get it...
What's going on here?
When the En was used, I was carrying this girl.
If the King had noticed,
he would have come straight to me.
He didn't because I had
concealed her within my hair.
It's possible that he didn't realize
I was carrying another person.
Are you following me?
It seems logical, so I can't argue that...
But I still don't see your point.
If she's covered up, the King
can't find her with his En.
Are you suggesting
that we let Knuckle and Meleoron die,
rather than make an exchange?
Of course not...
We'll offer to make an exchange.
But we'll try to buy as much time as we can.
To accomplish that, we must hide her in a place
where the King cannot find her.
Buy time? How long are we talking?
Until the King dies.
What is she talking about?
Until the King dies?
Sure, he has to die sometime...
But if we knew when he'd die,
we wouldn't have a problem!
Why are we okay now?
Give me a proper explanation!
The King will die, and it will happen soon.
Within the next few hours,
the King will die!
We need to go deeper...
Yes, we must put her in a place
where only we can find her.
That should do it.
All that's left is to negotiate,
without going far enough to make the King snap.
I know...
What we're doing is cruel.
We are no different from them.
No...
We are far worse!
Pitou... Pitou...
Where are you?
Pitou!
Next time: The Word x Is x That Someone.
And it isn't "Killua."
And that's all there is to it.
﻿We are no different from the Ants.
No...
We are far worse.
The rose was poisonous.
The poison, which spread
when the rose bloomed,
was superior to similar toxins
because it was immediately absorbed by
those in the area unfortunate enough
to survive the explosion.
Rapid destruction of their organs would begin,
and their bodies themselves
would become poisons that continued to
emit new poison, until the victim died.
The amount of poison for a lethal dose and
the amount of time until the subject died
perfectly created a chain of poisoned victims.
In other words,
it was a demonic weapon
more inhumane than any other.
The Word x Is x That Someone
Th-This is...
What is happening to my body?
Pouf.
Is something the matter, Meruem-sama?
Have you changed your mind?
In that case, we must evacuate you at once.
Your Majesty?
Even when I can see right through him,
he still refuses to divulge his secret.
Very well.
I only have to capture the remaining intruders.
I am very curious about your secret now.
You do not intend to change your
mind about telling me, do you?
I will keep my word, even if it costs me my life.
Good.
He's already using his final
permissible En search!
I can see
everything.
I see what has changed since
the first time I used En.
The footprints that were not there before.
An abandoned vehicle.
Youpi's corpse.
A door that has been opened.
And someone responding to my
En who did not previously.
Huh?!
Was it you who killed Youpi?
A-Absolutely not!
I am a mere Squadron Leader!
I would never have any reason to kill Youpi-dono!
Youpi-dono
was talking to me when he
suddenly coughed up blood,
became overcome with pain, and died.
I swear that I'm not lying!
I'm not lying...
Yes, I did attack Youpi.
But before he could answer my question...
Before my black centipedes could even hatch...
He died.
I believe that he must have been hit
by some sort of attack before encountering me.
That's why I came here to
investigate if any intruders
are hidden in the crowd.
The Royal Guard Pouf...
He's going to be trouble.
I'm pretty sure he has the
ability to read my mind.
Welfin is a serious threat.
I have no idea what he might tell the King...
Simply telling him to keep quiet
would be too lenient.
I should eliminate him immediately!
I should accuse him of being a traitor,
and execute him on the spot.
In any case, I must get him away from the King.
Meruem-sama, he is—
I know what you want to say.
I can now sense the emotions of
any that my En has touched.
I could feel his unbridled hostility toward me.
In...
Incredible...
Once someone has been exposed to my En,
I can see into their mind by simply looking.
So it wasn't just Youpi's wings and attacks.
The King also inherited my Spiritual Message...
And he's made it infinitely more powerful.
Your Majesty!
The King is invincible...
The King is unrivaled!
And yet...
Why?!
Why is my heart
filled with
such unease?
Now there is some fear mixed in,
but there is no concealing
your desire to kill me.
I am interested to learn
what drives your hatred of me.
Speak.
Lie, and you will regret it.
This is no time to let emotion
get the better of me!
Tell me what you know.
Meruem-sama!
You must follow the proper order.
He has deep ties to my secret.
However, he does not realize this.
If you continue questioning him,
it is very likely that he will reveal
part, or all, of my secret.
When the King has such power, lies are futile.
Then I must use the truth!
I believe that you would not want your reward
before winning the contest.
I will keep my secret hidden using only truth!
If you wish to continue our contest,
I believe you should wait to question him.
What is this guy talking about?
Secret? What secret?
Wait, what do I do now?
How do I escape from this monster?
Damn it!
I didn't realize he was this powerful!
I should have run away right off the bat.
Temptation got the better of me!
When I saw the giant Youpi
shrunken down like some bug,
and then he dropped dead,
I actually had the delusion that I could be King...
So I stayed...
I was drunk on my delusion!
I felt almighty, like some sheltered little kid.
I felt alive.
Yeah, I'm an idiot! I was drunk!
Too many things happened simultaneously,
and then I remembered Gyro.
I panicked and got sentimental,
and wanted to be a hero!
I thought I could avenge Gyro.
But Gyro isn't even dead...
He's alive, for sure!
I should have run,
and teamed up with him again
before seeking revenge!
Damn it!
It's that octopus's fault.
He threw me off my game.
He threw my emotions out of whack.
He led me astray!
Damn him! "Messenger," my eye!
I have to do something.
He knows my intent is hostile.
And I can't lie...
He'll send my head flying before
I can activate Missile Man!
What tools do I have left?
The message?
Pouf's secret?
The drive behind my hatred?
Everything that I know?
Will it be enough to save me? What do I say?
The first...
The first word I say is key.
Just one word will decide
whether I live or die.
If I choose the wrong one, it's all over!
This overwhelming pressure.
This abnormal tension.
Pouf, does that secret
have any relationship to the hatred
he feels toward me?
This is the King...
After interrupting me in the
middle of my questioning,
you gave me a direct order.
I presume that you are prepared
to accept the consequences.
I want a sincere answer.
This is...
The King's new power meant that
he could probe for the answer he sought
without waiting for Pouf to speak.
Despite the understanding that he
had Pouf's unwavering loyalty,
the murderous aura visibly
emanating from the King
indicated that Pouf would have no choice
but to atone with his death if that answer
was not what the King wanted.
Loyalty and hostility
were equally meaningless before the King.
No one could stop him.
Even then,
I was already
prepared to die.
I will sacrifice myself
to my own loyalty.
There is nothing that I can say.
Though the contest has yet to conclude.
That is all there is to it...
His incredible resolve and madness
stopped the King.
I am hungry.
However...
Welfin immediately understood...
I am...
I am going to be eaten!
One second later...
I'm dead!
Upon learning his fate,
Welfin instantly appeared
to age one hundred years.
I want to live.
That was when his past rapidly
flashed through his mind
and then scattered, the fragments
mingling with his present.
One word...
My first
and last!
Caught between the desire to live
and unavoidable death...
One word...
The message for the King!
One word!
What Pouf discussed with Pitou!
One word!
Pouf's secret!
One word!
I...
One word!
...won't die until I'm dead!
As his brain cells began working
harder than ever before,
he made a choice that he never would
have in normal circumstances.
Komugi?
This...
This is...
This is how deeply he values her!
Pouf...
This is your secret.
Yes.
He values her more than I feared.
Punish me for my actions.
No words are needed.
We are one now.
There will be no punishment.
I never had a chance...
Yes.
Continue searching for Pitou.
The two captured intruders
may have information.
Once you are done, release them.
I have nothing else to ask them.
All I can do is nod.
Yes.
The opened door...
And footprints leading inside.
The resolve of the two that I sensed with my En.
All signs lead to one conclusion.
Welfin...
Y-Yes!
Komugi is in the underground warehouse
with the woman and the octopus.
Your job was to deliver that information
to me or the Royal Guard.
H-How did you know that?
I believe the octopus was the
reason you accepted this job.
There was a different reason
why you did not complete it.
Is that reason the cause of your hatred for me?
So it is.
Do not worry.
Once you answer my question,
you are free to go wherever you wish.
You have my thanks.
You helped me to remember
something very important.
They said that they're waiting in Bizeff's
private courtyard, in Area D.
Gyro is the only man I'll ever call King!
You... All of you...
Are enemies!
Our enemies!
Is that so?
I hope you find him...
And if possible,
I hope you can live as a human.
Netero once believed
that the King was wavering
between human and Ant.
But now...
Next time: This Person x And x This Moment.
Will you call me
by my name?
Huh? Me?
﻿The King transformed his En
into countless particles,
and scattered them everywhere.
If there are conditions I must meet
for you to turn over Komugi,
speak.
This Person x And x This Moment
It appears that only one of you is here,
but I shall address this
message to both of you.
He knows exactly what we're doing.
We won't be able to trick him.
What I felt after coming into
contact with your Nen
was not anger, fear, or hatred.
Only senses of duty and resolve.
If you are fighting for the survival
of humanity, your battle is over.
You need further explanation?
It seems you doubt what you've just heard.
Then I shall repeat myself.
You have won... The battle is over.
The rest of what I have to
say is for your ears only.
The reason I am here is quite simple.
I have one motive...
I wish to see the human named Komugi.
That is all I want.
That is really all I want.
I desire nothing else.
After coming into contact with your Nen,
I learned my current state and fate.
And having learned my fate, I simply wish
to spend my remaining time with Komugi.
That is all I want.
Was this...
Was this a plan you devised after
discovering my personality?
No, I already know the answer...
It's impossible.
You expect me to believe you?
You think I'll just accept that explanation?!
An omnipotent King would
never lie to himself in order
to fool a lower being like me!
After all the killing you have done,
and soon will do...
A creature like you...
The King admits defeat? Cares for a human?
Impossible! That's impossible!
He's doing this because it is the truth!
I believe it was only a slight change...
Huh?
Something, somewhere, changed ever so slightly.
In my current state, I am not a god,
but I...
No...
Perhaps, I only feel this way
because everything has fallen into place.
You should know I have very little time.
I want you to tell me her location,
so I do not have to search for her.
What are you saying?!
Stop this...
Yes, I know where she is!
Why don't you just torture it out of me?
I know the answer.
We both know that isn't an option.
Your aura is as strong and beautiful
as any I have ever beheld.
Stop this!
All I can do is to ask you to help me.
Don't!
I am part Ant now...
I know very well how important
you are to the race...
Not that...
Don't go to such lengths...
You mustn't do that...
I'll tell you.
But on one condition.
May I use my power
to watch your final moments with her?
If that is what it takes to be with Komugi,
you certainly may.
Sorry, Killua...
I couldn't
keep our promise...
4-7-1, marshal...
Wake up, Komugi.
It's time to play.
We have a shocking news update.
The true purpose of the summoning
of all Republic of East Gorteau
citizens to the capital city
was a plot by the Supreme
Leader to massacre them.
The body of Supreme Leader Diego
was discovered under the rubble,
suggesting that the victims were
likely forced into mass suicide.
But the second-in-command,
Secretary Bizeff, is still missing,
so some authorities believe a
revolution is the greater likelihood.
Meanwhile, there has also been trouble
in the NGL region of the Mitene Union,
as international peacekeepers
have sent queries regarding refugees,
and have received no response.
There have been rumors of
illicit dealings between
East Gorteau and NGL,
and the international community
seeks to use this incident
as an opportunity to conduct
a more forceful investigation.
Yeah, the boss did his duty.
No, I wasn't there to see it.
It still isn't clear yet.
Yeah, we're waiting on Palm.
Can we really trust her alone
to verify the King's death?
Plus, that person was captured and
converted by the enemy, yes?
Well, that's a question of professionalism.
It would be professional
to provide a complete report
in the safest manner possible.
But those are the professionals who spend
all of their time sitting in fully-furnished offices.
And when we field Hunters are told
to trust a partner, we trust them.
We're all professionals...
But I'm the one out in the field!
I'm not sitting in an office!
The Vice Chairman's faction won't
accept that argument.
If they find out, you can expect
to be questioned, at the least.
Uh, I am Netero...
Chairman, thank you for a job well done.
May you rest in peace.
The same day, a video was streamed
online in which Netero announced
his resignation as Chairman
of the Hunter Association,
and gave instructions for
choosing his successor.
However, major news stories in the
government-run media overshadowed it,
and only a few realized that
the video was his will.
Now, let us drink.
Let us drink.
Drink to the human race.
In every age, there will be good
humans and bad humans.
Human life is too long
to devote to reproduction,
yet too short to devote to learning,
in the helix of time.
Perhaps that is why humans succumb
to desire and seek release.
Despite the fact that life is complete
with the sun, the land, and poetry.
Supreme Leader Diego (Real)
In his 30th year of retirement,
on a farm, in an unnamed country
It's over...
But it feels like we
haven't played in ages...
Playing in real life is completely different
than playing in my dreams.
Yes.
I thought I felt someone kick
me hard in the stomach.
After that, a strange person kidnapped me...
But you must have saved me, Supreme Leader.
It wasn't me. It was my subordinates.
I was wrong?!
I jumped to the wrong conclusion.
I was unworthy of their loyalty...
When they stop by, I must thank them.
I will relay your gratitude.
I'll be seeing them soon...
I know. Let's begin.
Yes!
Once, you asked my name.
Y-Yes...
My name is Meruem.
Meruem.
It means the light that illuminates all.
Meruem-sama?
M-My name is Komugi...
It is an honor to know you!
I know.
No...
That isn't true.
I knew nothing.
I didn't understand what really mattered.
Meruem-sama?
No honorific is necessary.
Don't make me repeat myself!
No honorific is necessary!
B-But, I could never do that!
I would never dare address
you without an honorific!
Then if I beat you at Gungi, you will
address me without the honorific.
I understand.
Do I die after I've addressed
you without the honorific?
Ah, that's right.
There is no need for you to die.
I am not the same person I was before.
You should be prepared to lose.
Yes!
What do you want if you win?
I would like another match!
It was a foolish question.
Let's begin, then.
1-5-1, marshal.
9-9-1, marshal.
7-9-1, pawn.
2-3-1, pawn.
2-7-2, musketeer.
Could it be?
7-1-2, fortress.
This is...
Marshal
...kokoriko?
Komugi, do you mean to mock me?
No.
I want a sincere answer.
I will not allow you to fool around.
Yes, I have never fooled around
while playing Gungi.
Very well.
If you lose, you will die.
Yes.
Certain Death
Is she saying this will not
mean her certain death?
She had a number of other options.
But all would only serve to lengthen the
game without increasing her chances.
If she thinks she has a chance to win...
9-2-1, new lieutenant general.
I want to see
where this goes!
4-6-2, spy.
Th-This is...
She
has found a way out.
That night, I realized something.
Quiet!
Let me think.
Here.
This is the only way to go!
I should be able to checkmate her!
When she's forced closer to my position,
my advantage grows with each move.
But if she slows down and allows
me a turn to attack,
she can't stop the knight
and lieutenant general!
2-6-1, knight!
I reversed her new move!
What now?
What is wrong?
Why do you cry?
Am I...
Am I allowed
to be so happy?
Can...
Can so many
wonderful things happen to someone like me?
I suppose I must tell you the truth.
I...
I have been poisoned,
and I have little time.
Meruem-sama...
Komugi, I wanted...
to spend my final moments
playing against you.
But this poison is contagious.
If you stay near me too long, you will also...
She reversed my reversal?
Meruem-sama...
Right now, I am very happy.
I may not be worthy,
but please allow me to join you.
I see...
I...
I believe
that I was born to be here today.
...was born for this moment.
Spy               Marshal
4-4-1, pawn.
6-5-1, knight.
2-7-2, new spy.
Komugi, are you still there?
Yes, I sure am.
I'm not going anywhere.
4-5-1, lieutenant general.
That's checkmate.
Komugi, are you still here?
Yes, yes... Right here.
Let's play another match.
The loser goes first.
Komugi...
Yes, yes? What is it?
It appears I never defeated
you a single time.
What are you saying?
We've just gotten started!
Yes...
1-5-1, marshal.
9-5-1, marshal.
Komugi, are you still here?
Yes, of course.
It's your turn, Meruem-sama.
I'm a little tired...
I need to take a short nap.
Will
you hold my hand?
Komugi?
Komugi, are you there?
I can hear you.
I understand.
Like this?
I'll wake up shortly.
Will you stay by my side until I wake?
I've never left your side.
I'll always be here.
Komugi...
Yes, yes? What is it?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Will you call me...
Yes?
...by my name one last time?
Good night,
Meruem...
I'll be joining you
soon.
Next time: Homecoming x And x True Name.
I'm home, Mito-san!
Welcome home, Reina-chan.
Eh? What?!
﻿Homecoming x And x True Name
With the death of King Meruem,
the battle between Chimera Ants
and humans was over.
Republic of Rokario
NGL Autonomous Region
Hass Republic
Republic of East Gorteau    Republic of West Gorteau
The Republic of East Gorteau and
the NGL were tentatively placed
under control of international peacekeepers,
and the nations essentially ceased to exist.
Between the two former nations,
five million survivors were declared refugees.
The Mitene Union's three remaining members
divided East Gorteau's riches and agreed
to jointly govern the former nation's territory.
As for the NGL,
there was a proposal to give all open land
permanent designation as nature reserves,
to prevent future incidents.
And the international community concurred.
It was agreed that the nature reserves would be
under the Hunter Association's jurisdiction.
Are you sure about this?
Yeah, I'm gonna live here.
The name "Gyro" doesn't mean anything to me.
But this place feels very familiar.
I'm guessing that I was an NGL resident
that didn't work for Gyro...
Well, I won't force you to come, then.
This is probably safer than other countries now.
Exactly.
One look at me, and the peacekeepers
would freeze on the spot.
Is that
why she's staying?
No, in her case...
She seems more like you guys.
What do you mean?
Hey! Aren't you done?
We'll leave you behind!
Damn, she's annoying... Give me a minute!
Well, people like me who barely
remember our previous lives
can tell that people like you and Hina,
who have their memories, are different.
There's something in your eyes.
Or it's how you look into the distance.
Somehow, I can tell at once.
"This guy remembers his past."
And I can tell that
she remembers her past.
Hina said she'll never talk to us...
But I don't think it's that she won't talk.
It's that she can't talk.
She's probably just a kid.
Welfin!
Zip it! I get the idea!
See ya.
We probably won't see each
other again, so take care.
Yeah.
Try not to die until you're dead.
The hell is that?
Gyro's way of saying goodbye.
It's one of my favorite phrases.
Did you just remember something?
No... I just kinda like the phrase.
Oh.
So life is what you make of it, huh?
Later.
Yeah.
Well, let's get going.
Okay! It's time to go look for Gyro-sama!
Seriously, you have no shame.
Not so long ago, it was
"Hagya-sama" this, "Leol-sama" that.
Who's that?
Huh?
No point in thinking about the dead.
I have to move forward!
Straight ahead!
Still... Are you sure we can
make it through the port?
Yeah, this is a government vehicle,
so once I show my card, they'll let us pass.
Soon, I'll be a resident of Meteor City...
How far I've fallen.
Don't be so negative about it.
Just be patient.
I'm sure that Gyro's also headed there.
It's possible that
he's already gathered all the sympathizers
and tools we'll need to build our own nation.
Which means...
In no time, we'll be back on top!
Yay!
You're so optimistic, I can only envy you.
Optimistic?
You've got that right.
I've already died twice...
But I'm still alive!
Nothing scares me now.
I'm ready for anything!
Plus,
I'm the one who stopped the King.
H-Hey...
Yeah, I'm a class-A political criminal.
Might as well enjoy whatever is left of my life.
Yeah, that's the spirit.
Humans are alive until they're dead!
What? You're stating the obvious!
Quiet!
Welfin, Hina, and Bizeff head to
Meteor City, in search of Gyro.
Is that the village?
Hey...
Don't worry.
I'm with you.
Monsters!
Well, that's to be expected.
Hey!
People of NGL!
I need someone who can communicate
in a peaceful and reasonable manner!
I'm not here to harm anyone!
I just have a question to ask!
Hey! You can speak?
Who are you?
Uh...
This will probably be hard to believe,
but will you hear me out?
You're the only people I can turn to!
Reina?
How did...
you know?
Reina...
Reina...
Reina!
How did you know?
Of course I knew...
I'm your mother! I'm your mother, Reina!
Welcome home.
I'm so glad you're back.
Brother tried to protect me!
He told the monster to go away,
and told me to run... He kept me safe!
But I was too scared to move!
I'm sorry!
It's okay... I'm sorry.
You and Kurt did your best.
I'm sorry I wasn't there with you.
I'm sorry I couldn't keep you safe...
Welcome home, Reina-chan.
You must be hungry.
Let's eat together.
Hey...
Why don't you join us?
No... I'll pass.
Don't say that.
You saved Reina-chan.
Please let us feed you.
That isn't what I was doing...
See ya.
Damn...
I've returned the favor, okay?
Damn that stupid octopus!
He never should've let me live!
Thank you...
Let's eat.
Let's eat
together.
Huh?
What's going on?
What... What's wrong?
Reina and Brovada return home.
Hello? Is this Colt?
It's me.
The politicians have turned this
into an international crisis.
The Ants are no longer involved.
No longer involved?
Is that actually possible?
That's what politicians do.
You'll be classified as a new Magical Beast.
Magical Beast...
Well, if they label you as a good
Magical Beast, you'll be fine.
Any changes on your side?
Actually, something has been bothering me.
Something bothering you?
Yeah, it's Reina.
No! You're wrong!
She keeps saying her name isn't Reina.
What is it, then?
I'm not Reina!
My name
is Kite!
Gon!
Killua!
Doctor...
How's Gon?
He's still in critical condition.
I wouldn't recommend sending
him to a specialist
until he can be taken off life support.
I've never seen or heard of anything like this.
How could this happen overnight
to a twelve-year-old boy?
I understand.
We'll bring the specialist here.
He's a hero who's earned special treatment.
I will cover all the expenses.
If necessary, we may have to
rebuild this entire hospital.
In any case,
we cannot let Gon die.
In the end,
you did everything by yourself...
I want that one myself!
I get it.
Kite saved your life, and he
has no connection to me.
But... Still...
I wanted you to ask for my
help in defeating Pitou!
Let's go.
Did you say that to me as a teammate?
Or as a friend?
I know...
This is just a tantrum.
It's the same as always.
You run ahead,
while I clean up after you.
The same as always...
I'll clean up your mess!
But this time, I won't let it slide.
You have to apologize.
I'm going to
heal you up!
So you have to apologize!
Killua...
We're assembling a team of
medical specialists to save Gon.
I must head back, so I can use
Hide and Seek to transport
equipment and people.
Will you come with me?
No, I won't.
That's true...
It's important to stay with Gon
and talk to him, as well.
I'm going to save Gon.
You go get those doctors.
They'll still be needed...
While I'm gone.
Killua?
I'm the one who'll save Gon!
Uh, I am Netero...
I'm resigning as chairman, so you're on your own.
The next chairman will be selected by election.
I am setting the condition that
all Hunters must vote.
If voter turnout is under 95%,
the results will be invalid.
I ask that the Zodiacs handle the details,
such as schedule and polling method.
I'd say the difficulty for this mission is D-rank.
I'm counting on you all.
Take care.
In response to Netero's message,
the Zodiacs, the Hunter Association's leaders,
assembled at headquarters that day.
Next time: Debate x Among x Zodiacs.
I won't say anything until I've seen your face.
I'm going to heal you up,
so you have to apologize!
﻿Chairman Netero gathered the top
leaders of the Hunter Association,
the Zodiacs, for the purpose of
electing the next chairman.
The Zodiacs...
Twelve Hunters whose abilities
the chairman had recognized.
In emergencies, he entrusted
them with leading the Association.
When nothing was happening, they
accompanied him in leisure activities.
Each Zodiac is assigned a code name...
And most members, out of
adoration for the chairman,
made moving efforts to embody their code names,
such as changing their names or personas.
However, there are exceptions.
Debate X Among X Zodiacs
Chairman!
Mizaistom (Ox)
I thought we had all the Zodiacs present,
but the Rat is missing.
Piyon (Rabbit)
The Vice Chairman is very busy,
even at a time like this.
Geru (Snake)
It's because it is a time like this.
He's scrambling to secure votes for himself, I'm sure.
Ginta (Sheep)
Chairman!
Ginta... You're loud, annoying, and you smell!
Cluck (Chicken)
Saiyu (Monkey)
Even the habitual slacker Ging showed up!
Guess the Rat's just a scumbag.
Ging (Boar)
What do you mean, "even" I showed up?
I'll kill you, monkey.
Go ahead and try it, dumbass.
Botobai (Dragon)
I can't accept this.
Why didn't the chairman call us to help?
Kanzai (Tiger)
Agreed.
Morel and Knov were above that kind of job!
"Above" is not the word you're looking for.
Cheadle (Dog)
You wanted to hunt the Ants yourself, did you not?
The chairman wanted all of us together for this.
Saccho (Horse)
Let's wait for him to arrive.
Hey! Sorry I'm late!
Pariston (Rat)
My apologies!
Everyone is in a frenzy over what's
going on with East Gorteau.
It's a big problem.
Just sit down.
Oh, sorry about that.
Then let's begin this meeting on the
election of the next chairman.
Hold on!
Why are you leading the meeting?
Huh? Is there a problem?
Don't boss us around after you showed up late.
Pariston, you're irritating!
You're a creep! Get lost!
Well, I wasn't sure if I should take the lead.
But you know, I'm the Vice Chairman.
I outrank the rest of you, and I'm
good at coordinating these things.
I'm sure you all want to finish this quickly.
That's why.
If we rank by age, Botobai-san should lead.
Judging by ability to foster progress,
Cheadle-san should lead.
Both are better suited to the task than I.
Would one of you be willing to take over?
I'll refrain. You'd probably give me a hard time.
I concur.
Forget it. Just lead the meeting.
Just come out and say you
want to do it, scumbag.
In that case, if anyone objects
to me leading this meeting,
raise your hand.
I object! I object! I seriously object!
I see four objections...
The majority says I should continue.
Of course, we can discuss any
complaints as they arise.
I'm ready to step down anytime.
Then, I have a proposal.
I will run for the position of chairman,
so let's not bother with an election.
I'm gonna kill you, brat!
Scary... Everyone calm down.
My point is that we'll waste time and money.
We already know the results.
No one here will vote for you.
That's eleven votes.
Together, you can only muster eleven votes.
Do you know how many Hunters
are in the Association?
The late Chairman Netero was too strong...
So he couldn't understand
the feelings of the weak.
The same can be said for all of you.
However, I can understand the weak!
That is the kind of Chairman I seek to be!
The weak end up as your slaves,
working under the name of intermediaries.
How much have you made off
them, Prince of Kickbacks?
Please, you have it wrong. I'm asking
them to contribute to the pool.
It's meant to help the Association expand.
Eighteen people.
Do you know what that number represents?
The number of Hunters who've
gone missing in the three years
since you became Vice Chairman.
As professionals who risk our lives,
we're obligated to be aware of the
situations our trusted associates are in.
A missing Hunter is more bizarre than
a Hunter's unexpected death.
Before you became Vice Chairman, the
average was 0.6 Hunters missing per year.
It's increased tenfold.
Do you have anything to say?
That number is tragic... It pains me greatly.
Once I become Chairman,
the number will surely decrease!
I'll run for Chairman.
I'm going to carry on the old man's will.
Don't want to vote for either of them!
Ging-san, I hear something
happened to your son...
Sounds like it.
Should I visit him?
Sure, he'd probably be thrilled.
Would he even realize I was there?
I heard he's in critical condition.
Maybe I shouldn't go after all...
If he dies after I do, I'll have wasted my time.
Go visit him.
He isn't going to die.
Uh, can I ask a question?
First, shouldn't we reevaluate
the process for running?
You're the one who started it!
What's wrong with your head?!
I only offered to serve in hopes
of saving us money and time.
If we can't avoid the process,
let's first decide how to go about it.
There we go!
When he controls the pace,
everything becomes more complicated.
In that case, we can draw lots.
Screw that!
How can we have our leader chosen by chance?
Are you a scumbag, too?
I'll give a sheet of paper to each of you.
Hey...
I want each of you to write what you believe to be the optimal election process,
with the prerequisite of achieving
at least 95% voter turnout.
And a third party will pick one
of the proposals at random.
A third party?
I'm guessing she means Beans.
Each proposal has a 1 in 12 chance.
So there won't be any hard feelings.
That's true...
Not a bad idea.
That's fine, since I won't lose.
But we should write down our names,
so we know whose idea is chosen.
She said the odds are 1 in 12, but that isn't true.
If the ten of us write something
that puts Pariston...
and Ging, if possible...
at a disadvantage, our odds will be 5 in 6.
If we record how each person votes,
Pariston will have an advantage.
Should we use anonymous ballots to allow
for dividing points among candidates?
Would our intermediaries then
betray us with no guilt or fear?
So here we are, Beans-san.
There are twelve sheets of paper inside.
Please pick one.
It will determine the rules
we will use for the election.
You want me to pick one?
This is an important task.
Then I will draw one.
The chosen proposal is Ging-san's.
Ging's rules...
He's no Pariston, but he's still trouble.
Rule #1.
"All Hunters are both candidates and voters."
Rule #2.
"If the winner of the first election fails
to receive a majority of votes,
the top sixteen will have a runoff.
If a majority is still not achieved, there will
be another runoff with half the candidates."
Rule #3.
"If the turnout for any given vote is under
95%, that vote must be redone."
Rule #4.
"Voters must write their name on the ballot.
Anonymous votes will be invalid."
What are you thinking?!
Why force people to sign them?
Are you an idiot? A total idiot?!
You are the idiots.
When everyone knows who voted for whom,
it's a lot more entertaining.
There's his problem...
He only cares about having fun!
Rule #5.
There's more?!
"The election committee chairman
will be Ging Freecss."
I didn't think of that!
I didn't include such a rule...
That was a mistake.
I was too focused on the actual rules.
This is what Ging really wanted.
Now he can control the election as he pleases.
May I say something?
This drawing was to determine how the
election would be conducted, correct?
Rules one through four are fine,
but the chairman should be chosen separately.
I can live with that.
You can?
This is a Hunter.
Frightening...
Two Days Ago
Ging-san!
Yo.
What brings you here so early?
I'm surprised you actually came.
Yeah, I happened to be in the area.
That can't be true...
Thank you very much.
I saw the old man's video.
Oh, that pen and notepad...
Huh?
Can you leave one by the phone
in the conference room?
Oh, there should already be one.
Oh, never mind, then.
Is there also a trashcan like this one?
Yes.
Why do you ask?
Four...
No, eight.
Read this.
These are rules for the election, yes?
Yeah.
What is this for?
In a few days, the Zodiacs will gather here.
Most likely, there will be a drawing.
Why would you say that?
If we tried to hold a vote or come to a
consensus, it would take too long.
Plus, Pariston will be there...
As far as he's concerned,
1 in 12 odds would be acceptable,
as long as it might give him an advantage.
Either way, it's a win for him.
And everyone else will think
their odds are 5 in 6...
That basically guarantees a drawing.
I expect Cheadle will propose it.
Saccho may protest.
Piyon would be a long shot.
Kanzai would be a really long shot...
And they'll ask me to hold the drawing?
There's no one else.
Everyone else in this building supports Pariston.
If these rules look acceptable, fold it three
times, and keep it until the meeting.
If they don't ask for you or if
I fold my paper differently,
I'll look at the floor, and you should
burn that piece of paper.
In my opinion, if you're willing
to become Chairman...
No, that won't happen.
Zero chance.
Sorry.
I'm not doing this because I
want to change the result.
All I'm doing is furthering the old man's will.
I'm not looking for any trouble.
But what about Rule #5?
That's a decoy.
If I leave that as Rule #5, it'll give people pause.
And if I agree to concede that rule,
they'll be more ready to accept the rest.
This is how criminals con people.
It's nothing special.
If Rule #5 passes, I'll resign.
Ging-san, why do this if you don't want
to change the result?
That's a strange question to ask.
If I can get my target to move as I want,
I've succeeded as a Hunter.
I just want to enjoy the process.
That's all.
The election committee was composed
of the twelve Zodiacs.
Cluck, one of the Zodiacs,
sent ballots to every Hunter.
The election for the 13th Chairman...
The Hunter Association has 661 members.
Which means that is the number of candidates.
Each Hunter must bring their own ballot.
Ballots may only be entered when at least three
committee members are present,
and identification has been verified.
The voting takes place in the Hunter
Association headquarters.
As long as three or more
committee members are present,
absentee ballots may be entered
at a different location.
The vote will take place
from 12:00 AM on August 8th
to 11:59:59 PM on August 8th.
This will not change.
Any voting that occurs away from headquarters
must follow this schedule.
Votes will be tallied the same day.
And it is now August 8th, 12:00 AM.
The vote begins.
May I put it in?
This is a surprise.
I wouldn't think
a murderer would be interested
in such an ordinary event.
Eighty-five points.
Yes, I'm not interested.
See? It's blank.
Then why are you here?
Ninety points...
Is someone named Ging here?
I'd like to speak to him.
He's already gone...
He said the next time we see
him here will be at the runoff.
Why don't you take your paper and leave?
Seventy-seven points.
Okay.
Heart is Valuable
You're bothering us!
Get lost! Aren't you done here?
He's assessing the goods.
Ten points, twenty points, forty-five points.
Ten points, two points, fifty points, thirty points.
I guess pro Hunters are still nothing special...
If I want someone to fight,
it'll have to be a Zodiac.
Ninety-five points!
Ah, I have the results for the
13th chairman's election.
Election for the 13th Chairman
1) Pariston — 249 (37.6%)

(Wrote own name only, misspelled name,
voted for previous chairman, no name given, etc.)
(Gon, Shoot, Kurapika, Killua,
Shalnark, and others, totaling 28)
None of the candidates received a majority.
The turnout was 87.7%.
As the conditions were not met,
the vote must be redone.
Hey!
Can't I take a look?
No.
I'm just curious!
I won't allow anyone to view the ballots.
Since I was designated election chairman,
this is my decision to make.
It's no fun if I can't see who voted for whom!
Scrooge! Baldy!
Moron.
Are you bored?
And yourself?
So, Hisoka...
You probably don't watch the news.
The election was held because
Chairman Netero died.
Rumors say he died alongside
the mutant Ants he was fighting,
and the Association received
a lot of land in reward.
Ants?
As I thought.
A lot's happened around the world,
while you were chasing Chrollo.
If you'd stopped to think for a moment,
you could have fought the
chairman or the Ants.
That would require stopping to think...
Maybe you can become my manager?
Gon and Killua also joined the Ant hunt.
Gon's on the verge of death, and Killua's
gone to speak to our father.
What did you say?
At this rate, they'll both die.
Both of them?
I can't have that happen.
Illumi, explain clearly.
There is actually another
younger Zoldyck brother...
I want to get rid of him.
Illumi, Milluki, Killua, Kalluto...
Who is the fifth brother they share?
Next time: Request x And x Wish.
﻿All I'm doing is furthering the old man's will.
I'm not looking for any trouble.
Ging-san, why do this if you don't want
to change the result?
If I can get my target to move as I want,
I've succeeded as a Hunter.
Request x And x Wish
On August 8th at 12:00 AM,
in the Hunter Association main headquarters,
the voting to elect Netero's successor,
the 13th Chairman, began.
Heart Is Valuable
The rules set by Ging
made all of the six hundred and sixty-one members
both a candidate and voter.
On this day,
voter turnout was below the required 95%,
meaning the vote had to be redone.
1) Pariston
2) Cheadle
3) Ickshonpe
4) Botobai
However, the second vote
Election for the 13th Chairman
1) Pariston — 251 (37.9%)
2) Cheadle — 46
3) Ickshonpe — 28
4) Botobai — 27
5) Mizaistom — 24
8) Cutie, Sanbica,
Teradein, Bushidora — 10
12) Loupe — 9
13) Linne, Biscuit — 8
15) Tsezguerra — 7
16) Knov, Kanzai — 6
18) Kite, Satotz — 4
20) Menchi, Geru, 13 others — 3
35) Saiyu, 11 others — 2
47) Gon, Hanzo, 16 others — 1
also failed to meet the requirements,
Invalid — 45                    Absent — 33
Turnout — 88.2%
Vote must be retaken because
requirements were not met.
and had to be redone again.
Taking the results from the
two votes into consideration...
First, we will have Beans-san review all ballots
before they are entered, to reduce
the number of invalid votes.
Second,
Hunters who violate the rules by
abstaining or submitting invalid votes
will have their licenses temporarily taken away.
Those are my two suggestions.
If we implement the first,
do we still need the second?
Just getting rid of the invalid
votes would put us over 95%.
I wouldn't be so sure...
Some Hunters may play hooky when they
learn they can't submit invalid votes.
There are those who would trample
on the former chairman's wishes.
What?
Drop it. You'll only waste time.
Oh? Did I say something wrong?
The former chairman declared that
a 95% turnout was required,
so Hunters who submit invalid votes or
won't vote are betraying his memory.
They just don't want to see you become chairman!
Then they should vote for someone else.
I'm sure there are other qualified candidates.
Though that isn't how the majority of Hunters feel...
Is that too hard for you, with your limited
vocabulary and math skills?
I told you that you'd only waste time.
You get a warning, Kanzai.
Before adding new rules,
I believe we should broadcast
each candidate's message.
Besides, abstaining and submitting invalid
votes are not technically violations.
I fully agree with your first statement,
but the second makes me
wonder if I heard right...
I cannot believe those words came from one
of the former chairman's leading supporters.
The former chairman said
that the difficulty of this election was D-rank.
Which means, for us Hunters with stars,
this should be a simple task.
In other words, the former chairman
trusted us to handle this.
Pariston, you're a pain!
Don't talk! Keep your mouth shut!
The difficulty level is just his way of
expressing his degree of trust in the Zodiacs.
If it's S, he's encouraging us.
If it's F, he's challenging us.
You can spin it however you want,
but abstaining and submitting invalid
votes don't violate any rules, scumbag.
When I called them violations...
I was only insinuating that those
Hunters are mistaken in their manner
of paying respects to the former chairman.
The message is that making the election
a success would be the right way
to pay our respects to him.
Then, say that during your speech!
If you make it a rule, that's coercion!
Is coercion such a bad thing?
Okay, I get the idea...
That's enough.
I'm fine with both suggestions.
My reasons are different than yours,
but I agree that, barring
extraordinary circumstances,
no Hunters should be abstaining
or submitting invalid votes.
Then let's take a vote.
First things first.
I hope you aren't going to say that,
during that time, Hunters who
have their licenses taken away
aren't considered pro Hunters.
You aren't that stupid, are you?
Of course not...
I wouldn't think of using such underhanded
logic to manipulate the vote.
Their licenses will be confiscated. Nothing more.
What if they're lost?
A Hunter who has lost his license
may be protected by the rules,
but is not qualified to be a pro
as far as we're concerned, yes?
Uh...
Are you saying that someone
would use the threat of a license going
missing to manipulate the vote?
We can't guarantee no one will do that.
Let this be clearly recorded in the minutes...
Hunters who lose their licenses during the election
will not lose their right to vote.
That way, no one can manipulate
the turnout or the majority.
I hate to admit it,
but unless we do something about
the majority, not just the turnout,
Pariston will keep smiling.
6) Saccho
7) Ginta
8) Morel
9) Piyon, Cluck
11) Cutie, Sanbica
He already seems to have secured the votes
that went to Ginta, Piyon, and Cluck.
6) Saccho
7) Morel
8) Cutie, Sanbica,
Teradein, Bushidora
12) Loupe
If our timing is wrong, there will be casualties.
I hate to admit it...
But some part of me
wishes that Ging were here.
A beast that cannot be tamed...
Why did the Chairman select
him as Vice Chairman?
Since I get to choose my second-in-command,
choosing a yes-man wouldn't be any fun.
It should be someone I can't stand...
That is who I want at my side.
Chairman,
I still believe you made a mistake.
Young Killua has returned?
That's great...
When I saw his name on the list of Hunters
who didn't vote, I was worried.
How's he doing?
He's opened Testing Gates 1 through 5?
Actually, his expression was what concerned me.
He looked very distressed...
I couldn't bring myself to speak to him.
If you run into his friend there,
can you relay a message?
Ask him to help young Killua.
Well...
His friend is why he's upset.
What? Gon-kun?
Young Killua...
Let me see Alluka.
I need her power.
Killua...
I don't have time, Dad!
I'll go even if you try to stop me, so come with me.
It's useless.
No one can control Alluka.
That's wrong!
You're wrong... Brother's wrong...
Alluka's a member of the family!
She isn't a machine!
As her brother, I'm asking her for help!
For help?
That child
is not human.
You shouldn't consider
that thing to be a member of the family.
What did you say?
That thing
is something that came
from somewhere else.
Sit.
If someone tries to dispel the restriction
and covenant Gon set for himself,
they'll be either repelled or killed.
If Alluka hasn't changed,
I'm the only one who can help her.
And Alluka's the only one who can save Gon.
Promise me one thing.
Never betray your friends.
If I ignore a friend I have the ability to help,
wouldn't I be betraying him?
Come with me.
I'm sure you already know this,
but no new requests have been made.
Who made the last wish?
Milluki.
He asked for the newest computer
available at the time.
He made the wish himself in Alluka's
presence, so he couldn't lie.
A computer shouldn't be that bad...
Was it because Illumi was controlling me?
How could I leave my little
sister in this situation?
Killua, I want to go over this again.
When making a wish to Alluka,
what are the rules?
It's not necessary...
I know Alluka better than anyone.
It's necessary.
Have you forgotten how many people have died?
We've killed more people!
Killua,
if you can't stay calm, we're stopping now.
Our promise matters to me because
I care about you, as your father.
Can you go over the rules for me?
Alluka is...
Mitsuba... Mitsuba!
Carry me.
Yes, yes... I will!
There!
Climb the stairs!
Yes, yes.
Raise me up high!
Yes, yes.
There you go!
Mitsuba...
Yes, yes? What is it, Master Alluka?
Yes... Master Alluka's
face suddenly changed!
Yeah, it's okay. I can handle this.
Alluka, lift me up high!
'Kay.
Up high...
Up high...
'Kay.
See? She's back.
Keep this a secret from everyone.
Oh, I already told your mother...
What?
But it was our secret!
It happens after three requests are fulfilled...
Yep, her eyes turn black.
And they turn back after Alluka lifts you up high?
No, then Alluka grants a wish.
I didn't understand at first...
So I wished for her to tell me
how to turn her eyes back,
and Alluka told me.
Do you remember the exact words Alluka said?
After she grants a wish, her eyes turn white.
And when three of her requests
are fulfilled, they turn black.
Refuse any requests that Alluka makes.
No matter how small they are.
Yes, I understand.
Mitsuba... Carry me!
I can't do that, Master.
Then, Mitsuba, shake my hand.
Oh, um...
I can't do that, Master.
I'm sorry.
Then I want a piggyback ride, Mitsuba.
I'm sorry... I can't.
What should I do?
Come on, Master!
Let's go catch some bugs.
Okay?
Then, Mitsuba, lift me up high.
I can't do that, either, Mast—
Mitsuba was in the play area...
Hasamu was in the butlers' quarters.
So two people, in different locations,
were instantly crushed at the same time...
What is happening?
It's because she refused.
She refused four of Alluka's requests.
Yasuha, piggyback ride!
Yes, Master.
Master Alluka...
Can you make me
a millionaire?
'Kay.
'Kay.
There has been a mysterious incident
in which an airship transporting money
suddenly went missing, and when it
was found, all the money was gone.
The pilot and crew members have
provided baffling explanations.
It will take a while to determine the cause.
I'm very sorry!
I couldn't help myself...
I find it hard to believe that
this was just a coincidence.
When Alluka is with us...
He never makes any requests.
Dad, can you let me choose the next butler?
So your mission is to fulfill Alluka's requests.
Yes... I understand.
If you clear this mission,
I will spare you and your lover.
Hey, Kasuga...
Yes, what is it?
Give me your liver.
Um, that's not...
You know?
You won't do it?
Then, Kasuga, give me your duodenum.
Please wait, Master...
Let's play a different game! Okay?
You won't do it?
Then, Kasuga, give me your spine.
Master!
Master... Please...
Then, Kasuga...
Give me your brain.
When three of Alluka's requests are
fulfilled, she'll grant one wish.
There probably isn't any limit
to the wishes she can grant.
My guess is that she can grant any wish.
Wish
But the bigger the wish she grants...
Request 1
Request 1                   Request 2
The bigger the next three requests will be.
Request 3                  Request 1           Request 2
In other words, an equivalent exchange.
And the sacrifice isn't made by the
one whose wish was granted.
It's the next person who fulfills the requests.
Request 1                             Request 2
If someone denies four of
Alluka's requests in a row,
that person and their most loved one,
meaning a minimum of two people, will die.
The bigger the wish, the more people
die when the requests aren't fulfilled.
After that wish, sixty-seven people died,
and those are just the ones we knew of.
Thinking of the family that
has been separated...
Thinking of the friend who is dying...
What will Killua do next?
Next time: Alluka x And x Something.
﻿While Killua returned to the Zoldyck
compound for a reunion with Alluka,
who was locked up deep underground...
I'd say there were six other cases
in which two people died...
Our mother didn't believe Killua,
so that was another pair.
Another pair died to satisfy her curiosity.
Even after she was convinced,
she sacrificed two more pairs to verify
how the other victims were chosen.
Then Milluki
exchanged the lives of two pairs
of tourists for some cheap toys.
During that time, there were two major incidents.
There were thirteen confirmed deaths in
the first, and sixty-seven in the second.
Kill him for me.
Milluki was responsible for the first one.
I want to be a millionaire.
Yasuha, the butler, was
responsible for the second.
Alluka x And x Something
Sure, a few pictures are no problem, Muna-san.
I'm just taking Alluka and Kalluto for a walk.
Oh, they're my younger brothers.
Incredible!
Hey, Muna...
Eat this.
Hmm?
Huh?
Oh, sorry...
He likes to make requests.
You only need to refuse.
Kill him for me.
Figuring out the tourist incident wasn't easy...
But since another butler paid the
price for the butler's incident,
it was easy to track down the victims.
After investigating, I realized something.
The criteria that determines who dies
is different for more than two people.
Perhaps there are different
rules for when a pair dies,
and when many people die.
Zoldyck butlers are trained in
a facility on our property.
At the exact moment Kasuga died,
every butler in her class at that
facility was wrung to death.
Her head teacher and specialized teachers also died.
Butlers from other classes...
Friends from her orphanage...
Her foster parents and their parents...
All people she was close to.
Still, that she liked all of her
classmates was impossible, right?
It becomes clear when you look at her
hospitalized biological mother.
Every month, she could only meet
her mother for half an hour.
Records from Kasuga's student days say she
loved her mother most in the world.
But her mother, in the hospital, survived.
Well, people change...
Love and hate are two sides of the same coin.
I agree, but that wasn't the case here.
It wasn't that she began to hate her mother.
Rather, she found someone she loved more.
Kasuga had just begun a relationship.
She'd spent even less time with her lover
than she had with her mother.
But wait...
You didn't investigate her past after the fact.
You chose her to test after learning her past.
Oh, you could tell?
Yeah, that's right.
We used her to confirm our suspicions.
Since our butlers aren't allowed to
have relationships, or they're killed.
The first incident made it clear
that this power was dangerous.
Capable of destroying the Zoldyck
family, if we didn't understand it.
After investigating the first incident
and reaching a conclusion,
the second incident confirmed it.
If you fail to grant four of Alluka's requests,
you must pay with your life.
When the price is two lives,
you and the person you love most will die.
When more than two must be sacrificed,
you and the person you love most will die,
along with, in order, those you've
spent the most time with.
So Kasuga's mother didn't die because she
hadn't spent enough time with her.
And Kasuga's lover died,
despite his short time with her.
This is a problem.
Isn't it?
Killua will make a wish to Alluka, to restore Gon.
If Killua makes the wish
and lets someone else fulfill the requests,
there shouldn't be any problem.
But I'm sure Killua will do things
the other way around.
Brother!
Alluka...
Killua will have someone else make the wish,
and will then attempt to fulfill the
consequent requests himself.
Sorry about leaving you down
here for so long, Alluka.
I'm sorry.
It's okay! I'm really happy!
I've missed your scent...
The leader of the monsters was strong enough
to force Netero to resort to the Rose.
To defeat one of its subordinates,
Gon's restriction and covenant must
have been harder on him than death.
Restriction                                                                      Covenant
A wish to reverse that would far exceed
the power of money and medical science.
The wish will likely be granted.
And then, Killua will do whatever
he can to fulfill Alluka's requests.
Killua will receive requests he cannot fulfill.
Still, Killua will try his best, and fail halfway.
Mission failed.
The one he loves most, or the
one he's spent most time with...
Either way,
the restored Gon will still die.
Huh?
Huh?
Oh.
Am I wrong?
When you mentioned that "both" would die,
were you referring not to Killua and Gon,
but to Killua and yourself?
Yes, that's right.
I have issues, but you are just as bad.
And if things go wrong,
it won't only be Killua, Gon, and me.
Every Zoldyck will die.
I'm thinking that this wish will cost
tens of thousands of lives.
So you'll probably die, too.
That's why your comment surprised me.
Oh, this is a problem...
Brother, die.
Okay, sure.
Bang!
I'll ask Killua to follow proper procedure
when he makes his wish.
I want you there, hidden.
If Killua either refuses,
or agrees, but you feel he's lying,
I want you to dispose of Alluka.
He has no combat abilities.
You can consider him an ordinary child.
We just don't know where he came from.
Third Election for the 13th Chairman
1) Pariston — 258 (39%)
2) Cheadle — 49
3) Botobai — 31
4) Ickshonpe — 28
5) Mizaistom — 27
6) Morel — 18
7) Teradein — 17
8) Saccho — 15
9) Sanbica, Bushidora — 14
11) Loupe — 11
12) Cutie, Biscuit, Linne — 10

18) Kite, Satotz — 4
20) Menchi, 6 others — 3
27) Saiyu, 3 others — 2
31) Gon, Hanzo, 21 others — 1
There were 68 absentees.
Absentees — 68              Turnout — 89.7%
The turnout was 89.7%.
Oh, dear... Oh, dear... Oh, dear.
This is strange.
In the second vote, there were
thirty-three absentees.
This time, we have sixty-eight absentees.
More Hunters were absent.
Is this because they previously
submitted invalid votes,
which is no longer possible?
So they chose to put their licenses
on the line by not voting at all?
What's going on?
Why would they go that far?!
Then it's okay if we take licenses
from anyone who's committed both offenses?
Yes, I suppose we have no choice.
Cluck-san, this is the list.
Please send them a letter
that says these two things:
They must bring their licenses to headquarters.
And that we expect them to explain their absences.
I don't know...
Will that really be enough?
Once they lose their licenses,
violators gain exemption from the rules.
They no longer need to fear
the penalty for not voting.
Taking away their licenses was your idea!
Huh? But we put the proposal to a vote.
Besides, everyone was against the idea
of temporarily stripping them of Hunter status.
If my goal had been to quickly improve turnout,
then I would have agreed.
Yes, he's hard to deal with
because he readily accepts
suggestions that hurt him.
And he'll even propose ideas
disadvantageous to him.
It's as though he enjoys the obstacles.
That's the one aspect that's
similar to Chairman Netero.
And I don't like it!
So I have a proposal.
I think the twelve Zodiacs should give a speech
before all of the Hunters.
We must express this election's importance!
For the Association...
For humanity...
For the world!
Speaking through a screen is no good.
We must look each of them in the eye,
and let them hear our voices,
and feel our souls in person.
For the sake of the former chairman!
This is why
I hate your guts, Pariston!
Brother, wake up!
Boo!
You're so good!
Alluka's power has rules the rest of
the family doesn't know about.
Brother, let's play shiritori.
Okay, sure.
Then...
I'll start with the ending "A" in "Alluka"!
The one that calls me "Brother" is the real Alluka.
The one that calls me "Killua"
is something else.
Brother, pat my head.
Sure.
Killua's being a model big brother.
That's three requests down.
So a computer was no big deal...
S-S-Sorry, Papa...
I won't do it again!
That means Alluka is ready.
Yep, Killua just has to make his wish.
Milluki, I want you to go over the rules again.
Ah, sure.
I'm aware of five rules.
One.
When someone fails to fulfill one of
Alluka's requests, causing them to reset,
the request difficulty returns to level 1.
That's the best time to make a wish to Alluka.
Two.
Once Alluka starts making requests to someone,
he will not switch his requests
to someone different.
That's why I always ensured
that Alluka made a request
to a butler before sending
him to you and Mama.
I'd guess Killua did the same thing.
That's why Alluka has never made
any requests of you two.
Three.
If the person receiving Alluka's requests
dies before clearing them all,
it's considered a failure,
and at least one more will die.
This was confirmed by experiment.
Four.
If he doesn't know someone's name,
Alluka can't make requests of them.
Five.
The same person can't make two wishes in a row.
That's all I know.
I'm not hiding anything from you!
I swear on the deal we made.
Why isn't Killua making a wish?
He probably has some foolish idea...
If Killua makes a wish now,
someone else will have to clean up the mess.
That makes no sense.
Can he not save his friend first,
and worry about the consequences later?
Papa...
Would his friend be happy to know
that many lives were sacrificed to save him?
No!
That's what's going through his head.
Since he's stupid.
His mind doesn't work the way ours do.
That's why you had Illu-nii use
his needles on him, right?
He's moving.
Father, open the door.
No.
Make the wish in that room.
We cannot let you go outside.
As I thought.
They don't know about any of these rules.
Father,
I am definitely your son.
You called Alluka "something that
came from somewhere else."
Right?
I call the black-eyed Alluka "Something," too.
We're leaving.
I'll clean up my own mess.
Something,
if we haven't left the mountain in half an hour,
kill my mother!
Huh? Hey, Killua!
If we've left the mountain in half an hour,
I want you to kiss me on the cheek.
Got it?
'Kay.
Mama!
Killua...
How...
How can you issue such cruel commands?
It's magnificent! You've grown up!
Damn! You're allowed to do that?
As long as only one wish is granted,
you can give yourself options!
Father,
open the door.
Something is skilled at destroying,
but fixing isn't her forte.
When she's fixing,
she must touch the target,
or her power won't work.
If we've left the mountain in half an hour,
I want you to kiss me on the cheek.
I will save both Gon and Alluka!
Killua's determination to save Gon
has set events in motion.
And that man returns.
Next time: Join Battle x And x Open Battle.
﻿Something is skilled at destroying,
but fixing isn't her forte.
When she's fixing,
she must touch the target,
or her power won't work.
I will save both Gon and Alluka!
Join Battle x And x Open Battle
Impossible...
There's no way I can remove this!
My power is not enough
to bear this burden.
Killua?
Where are you now? Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm on my way back.
How'd it go with Gon?
No luck.
When we told him about Kite,
there was no response on the monitors.
A lot of people have dropped by to talk to him.
But there's been no reaction.
Right, I understand.
I doubt we can heal him with normal measures.
Wait! Don't be too hasty, Killua.
As you said, Gon used a restriction
and covenant to temporarily
wield an immense amount of Nen, right?
Then it's best if we let a
Nen exorcist take care of it.
We can wait until we've exhausted all our
options to resort to riskier measures.
Oh, sorry. That didn't come out right.
I'm not talking about taking a crazy gamble.
In fact, I can guarantee Gon will be healed.
Let me take care of this.
This method isn't as risky as using a Nen exorcist.
But the problem is how I can get there.
This time, that will be the biggest challenge.
Wh-What do you—
Forgive me, Master Killua.
Is that you, Gotoh?
I can't let you continue that conversation,
on the grounds of secrecy.
I didn't tell him anything secret!
Not true.
You said you could guarantee Gon would be healed.
That was a reference to Master Alluka's power.
At the moment, you are still
just within Zoldyck property,
but outside the boundaries, you are already
at alert level 4, so please be careful.
So he was waiting for me to give Morel a hint?
You're too easy on me, Gotoh.
I do not understand what you mean.
Level 4...
Looks like I pissed off my father.
When one's outside alert level is 4,
restrictions are placed upon
what the target can do and say.
To enforce this restriction,
multiple butlers and family members
are assigned to monitor the target.
Restricted
If a restriction is violated,
the target will immediately be
captured and returned home,
Restricted
and the alert will automatically increase to level 5.
At level 5,
the moment a single step is
taken outside Zoldyck property,
the target is captured.
What's the reason?
The reasons are unauthorized
removal of a classified object,
rebelling against your parents,
and use of threatening actions.
Alluka's an object?
There are three restrictions.
First, to protect family secrets,
the target may not speak to,
or exchange items with,
any outsiders without permission.
To enforce this, the target is forbidden
to carry any communication devices.
I've already had everything taken away.
Second, to protect family secrets,
the target must stay within one meter
of Master Alluka at all times.
Yeah, yeah.
I don't plan on letting her out of my sight.
Third, to protect family secrets,
you are forbidden from letting any outsiders
learn anything about Alluka's power.
I understand perfectly.
So basically...
This is what I have to do.
This way, I don't have to ask permission
every time I do something.
While we're traveling, I'll let you
handle all the arrangements!
I understand why I am here.
But why is Canary here?
Moron!
Alluka's a girl.
I can't trust a lump like you to take care of her!
There is nothing to worry about.
We shall also accompany you.
Master Silva did not believe
that two butlers would be enough.
Tsubone!
Dad really is pissed...
It's fine.
I won't do anything stupid at alert level 4.
Listen to me, Killua-chan.
I'm not as lenient as your father and Gotoh.
A single violation, and I'll take you home.
Nothing will change that.
If you resist, I'll knock you out.
Keep that in mind.
Are we clear?
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Tsubone-sensei is the only person
in the entire household who
calls Master Killua "Killua-chan."
No bullying Brother.
I'm sorry...
Alluka-chama is so kind.
I won't do it again.
I just realized something.
I have trouble dealing with old ladies.
Do you love your big brother?
I love him lots!
Then you should do as he says.
Okay!
Master Killua is depending on me.
All so he can save his friend,
regardless of the risks.
I will help him!
Even if it costs me this job
or my life.
I am Amane. It's a pleasure.
Canary.
The pleasure's mine.
Tsubone!
Give me the nail of your pinky.
She made a request of Tsubone!
This is the worst time for it!
Even I don't know when, and of whom,
Something's requests will come.
Yes, absolutely.
Master Killua,
I will go into hiding for the time being.
This means that Master Alluka
will not make requests of anyone else.
Unless I change my mind.
Do you understand what I mean?
Of course, I will remain near you at all times.
I still have more requests...
She pulled a fast one!
It's all right.
I still have a chance.
I won't be able to make a wish,
but I can issue a command!
Brother, are you angry?
It's okay.
There's nothing for you to worry about.
I will save you!
Yes?
Yes.
Yes.
That's right.
This is Master Killua's phone.
No, I cannot answer that question.
I cannot answer that question, either.
In that case,
you should state your name first.
Goodbye.
Who was that?
It was...
Hello?
My name is Leorio!
Can you put Killua-kun on the phone?
Shh!
Wow, that brings back memories!
It has been quite some time, Master Leorio.
Huh?
Oh! I remember!
It's the coin guy!
Master Killua is currently on his way
there, accompanied by us.
Yes, to help Master Gon.
However, there are strict conditions
that must be met.
Hey, there...
Conditions to save a friend?
Are you dreaming?
If you need help waking up,
I'll speak more loudly!
Keep your mouth shut.
What did you say?
Master Killua is risking his life.
He's heading to you, against his family's wishes.
You should know that the Zoldyck
family is very special.
We are the ones who set the conditions.
So shut up and listen, fool.
Gotoh...
Please excuse me.
Let me talk to him.
It'll be faster that way.
Don't worry.
I won't say anything I'm not supposed to.
One violation, and I'll be sent home, right?
Yo, it's been a while.
Killua!
When you get here, let me talk to that guy.
Are you okay?
Yeah, but I can't say anything specific.
I need you to trust me.
Do as Gotoh says.
Yeah, got it.
Put him back on.
I'll ask about the conditions.
Let me talk.
Uh... Morel-san, was it?
This is my phone, and I'm talking to my buddy,
so why should I let you talk?
An excellent question.
The answer is to give me the phone.
No way. Get lost.
Very well.
Then, I have a favor to ask.
My guess is that you'll say, "That isn't possible."
In which case, you should hand over the phone.
Because I can make it possible.
Hello?
No, it's nothing.
Tell me the conditions.
When we arrive,
there must be no one inside
the building except Master Gon.
Not even doctors?
Correct.
Or any other patients?
Correct.
That isn't possible!
This is a national hospital!
Do you have any idea how
many people are in here?!
Hello?
I understand the conditions.
Leave it to me.
What is the plan?
This is a big hospital,
with a big parking lot.
We'll set up a private room for Gon there.
It'll be arranged so you can
drive in and out of the area.
I'll make sure that no one can learn
what you do inside.
Understood.
That satisfies our requirements.
What is your name?
I'm Morel.
From now on, I'd like you to
be the one I speak with.
There you go.
Oh, I need to make another call.
Knov?
It's me.
The situation's changed.
I need you to make sure the equipment
is operable in an outside room.
No, no monitors.
And we can't have any windows.
True...
It sounds like they have a Nen exorcist,
since they don't want anyone watching.
But Killua made it sound like something else.
The only Nen exorcist in the Hunter Association
said Gon was beyond help.
But Killua said he could heal him with no risks.
No, let's not pursue the matter.
Killua said to let him take care of it.
In the field, the rule is to listen when
a trusted friend tells you to.
Morel, I'll let you handle all contact with Killua.
Yeah, I've got it.
What are you going to do?
There are several people
I need to have a word with.
Gon's fighting for his life...
Where are you, and what are you doing?
Why won't you answer your phone,
Kurapika?
And so, the Zodiacs respect the
former chairman's wishes.
And we've worked diligently to maintain
the status quo, and we seek
to better the Association.
Your vote, no matter for whom
you vote, will not go to waste!
You can be assured of that.
At the same time,
I'm sure that some people are dissatisfied
with the current state of the Association,
or want to shake up the leadership.
However, I must ask
that you do not express that opinion
by refusing to cast a vote.
You are more than welcome to make
a speech up here, on the spot.
All you have to do is speak up.
We will never seek to smother a minority opinion.
We have Ging here,
who commits countless violations every year,
but still calls himself a member of the Zodiacs.
If you intend to skip the vote,
you might as well vote for him.
Ah, that was meant to be a joke.
This was the final mission the
former chairman gave us.
The entire Association should
work together to clear it!
Okay, thank you very much, Vice Chairman.
Please return to your seat.
Make it quick.
We now open the floor to everyone here.
If you'd like to express your views or
ask a question, raise your hand.
Okay, the big guy in the dark suit... Go ahead.
I'm Leorio, from the 287th class.
I have a question for that guy named Ging.
That's Gon's dad.
Why haven't you gone to visit Gon?
You must know his current condition!
Okay, let's hear the answer.
First, what is your relationship to Gon?
We're buddies.
Oh... I appreciate it.
I hope you'll stay friends with him.
That's all.
Answer my question!
Or just go visit him!
Go visit Gon!
I've heard he has a number of friends like you.
That should suffice.
Don't give me that bull!
Do you have any idea how much
Gon wants to see you?
If you talk to him, he might recover!
Did he say
that he wanted me to visit?
He couldn't say it if he wanted to...
You damned
bastard!
You can go to hell!
Wow!
You'll find footage of today's entire
meeting on the Hunter site,
so tell everyone who wasn't present!
Tell them they absolutely have to watch it!
The Zoldyck family has different plans for Alluka.
And this man never changes.
Next time: Magician x And x Butler.
﻿Wow!
You'll find footage of today's entire meeting—
the entire meeting—on the Hunter site,
so tell everyone who wasn't present!
Tell them they absolutely have to watch it!
Magician x And x Butler

Wow!

Master Illumi...
Yes, at once.
Please wait one moment.
Thanks to Gotoh,
I can see it now...
Our family's correlation chart surrounding Alluka.
Despite what he says, my father trusts me.
That's why Gotoh was allowed to accompany us,
and he won't force me to stop.
However, he's wary of Alluka's power.
Which makes sense, given that one wrong move
is all it takes for the entire family to die.
But on the other hand,
he wishes to control Alluka's power.
That dilemma shows in his decision to
lock her up in a room filled with toys.
That's why he had Tsubone and Amane,
his most trusted butlers, accompany us.
If something happens, they can
take us back immediately.
And he hopes they'll glean some hint
to help him control Alluka.
Tsubone and Amane understand their role,
and they're being very cautious.
Gotoh and Canary are being subtle,
but they're on our side and helping us.
And then,
there's Illumi.
The moment his name was spoken,
Amane's tension spiked.
This means Amane and Tsubone,
and Father and Grandpa by extension,
disagree with Illumi.
I'd guess that Illumi's plans for Alluka are...
That was a fine play, Gotoh.
You threw out his name to see Amane's reaction.
If Tsubone were here,
she would have noticed Gotoh's reaction
when he answered the phone,
and she'd have distracted me or signaled
Amane to shut off her emotions.
This is an internal family struggle,
an inner mission.
When family members differ
in opinion or objective,
they're each encouraged to do things their
own way, rather than unite in the same goal.
This is a contest!
Father and Grandpa want Alluka
near, so they can control her,
and they don't want me hurt by her power.
I want
to save Gon
and to set Alluka free.
And...
Illumi wants
to kill Alluka!
Is this Killua?
Yeah.
You removed the needle, didn't you?
Yeah.
I feel a lot better.
Then I won't have to hold back when I kill you.
Kill?
Me?
You can't kill family members
during an inner mission.
Family is off limits.
Hey, hey, Amane...
Isn't this part great?
Why is this story so mysterious?
Is that what
Father meant?
You shouldn't consider that thing
to be a member of the family.
They're all thinking
the same thing!
Fine...
I'll beat you at your own game.
Then, let's begin.
Master Killua!
Don't let go of Master Alluka!
Yeah, I got her.
If you two are more than a meter apart,
Amane will capture Master Alluka,
and Tsubone will take you home by force!
Oh, dear.
That was excessive.
I thought you were going to ask him first.
I have a little bird who brings me information.
And after examining that information,
there's something that bothers me.
Killua is hiding rules from us.
If there are rules I don't know about,
trying to negotiate with him is pointless.
He might accede to my demands
because they favor him.
So I'll dispose of Alluka before he has
a chance to use that advantage.
I just need you to eliminate the butlers
while you look for a chance
to take Alluka from Killua.
For now.
Okay.
By the way,
am I allowed to kill Killua?
I will
kill you.
Right here.
Right now.
I was kidding.
You're oozing bloodlust.
Is that all right?
Illumi's bloodlust!
Oh, damn.
Was that on purpose?
Certainly not.
If at all possible, I'd like Gon to live.
Having more toys is always more amusing.
Well,
only if it's possible.
It's okay. Brother's got you.
Keep your eyes closed and hold on tight.
Uh-huh.
Try to stay away from Master Illumi.
If he knows the route we're taking,
it's best to change directions.
I concur, but...
It's hard for me to agree with you.
My grandmother and I are not your enemies.
Not right now.
But that could change if my
father's mood changes.
Master Silva and Master Zeno
are not your enemies.
Our mission is to bring you home safely.
If that doesn't include Alluka,
you're all enemies.
Godspeed!
Speed of Lightning!
It's me. The situation's changed.
We've been separated from Master Killua.
We'll need four vehicles now.
We'll follow the same route.
If Master Killua contacts you,
follow his instructions, but avoid
any sensitive information.
Master Illumi is aware of our movements.
One of the butlers or a family
member is helping him.
Be sure to stay alert.
Understood.
Ah...
You've grown, Master.
If I hadn't known about that
technique beforehand,
I wouldn't have had time to react.
He will become an excellent assassin.
Oh, dear. These days, it doesn't
take much for me to tear up.
In that case, he won't let Master
Illumi get the better of him.
I shouldn't say that.
But I find it difficult to like Master Illumi
and Master Milluki, who resemble their mother.
Now, then...
Time to set aside personal emotion.
If he breaks the rules, everything changes.
I need to devise a way to subdue Master Killua,
taking his speed into account.
Okay! We should be far enough
away to take a break.
I'd like to use Speed of Lightning to keep going,
but to be safe, I should save my
energy for getting into town.
Brother?
Am I a nuisance?
If I were gone, would everyone get along better?
Alluka.
If...
I were the only person in the
world who really loved you,
would you be sad?
I'm so happy, I can't stop smiling.
Okay?
I'll always be with you!
You don't need to worry about anyone else.
Someone's there.
Is it Tsubone?
Is it Illumi?
I guess this won't be easy.
That's fine!
Let's go.
Who are you?
A magician who wishes to stay anonymous.
You two
shouldn't be trying to fight back.
Just evade his attacks.
Save your energy for the mission at hand.
You should follow Master Killua.
I'll play with you.
A power that lets you rapidly fire coins
with more power than bullets...
Your power is strong enough to explain why
you'd send your subordinates away.
My coins pack enough power that you
can't escape unscathed if they hit.
He must have used his power.
My aura possesses the qualities
of both gum and rubber.
Elastic Love
Bungee Gum
You've said too much.
I hope you don't regret it, you hack magician!
Telling my name to someone
about to die is pointless.
It doesn't matter that you
know what my power is.
Hisoka and Gotoh
are about to engage in battle.
A barrage of coins.
A net of gum.
While a furious battle takes place,
Illumi pursues the fleeing Killua.
Next time: Needles x And x Debt.
﻿You removed the needle, didn't you?
Yeah.
I feel a lot better.
Then I won't have to hold back when I kill you.
Kill?
Me?
You can't kill family members
during an inner mission.
Family is off limits.
You shouldn't consider that thing
to be a member of the family.
They're all thinking
the same thing!
Fine...
I'll beat you at your own game.
Needles x And x Debt
To save Gon, Killua is heading
for the city with Alluka.
Hisoka, who is working with Illumi to kill Alluka,
confronted Gotoh and the other
butlers escorting them.
A power that lets you rapidly fire coins
with more power than bullets...
Your power is strong enough to explain why
you'd send your subordinates away.
My coins pack enough power that you
can't escape unscathed if they hit.
He must have used his power.
My aura possesses the qualities
of both gum and rubber.
You've said too much.
I hope you don't regret it, you hack magician!
Telling my name to someone
about to die is pointless.
It doesn't matter that you
know what my power is.
Rubbish!
Catch.
Were my eyes just accustomed
to your attack that time?
It looked slower.
Yeah, it was a lot slower.
Because I diverted some
power to make them spin.
If you don't release your ability,
you'll be strangled by your own aura.
Or would you prefer your body riddled with holes?
Pick your poison.
Bungee Gum, undo.
He dodged my attack from that position?
He's fast.
I can't follow him!
I sent my gum out with the first card...
So it would be ready to activate anytime
after I removed the gum from my feet.
Now,
this evil magician has a lethal pop quiz for you.
I took twenty-two coins from your attack.
How many coins will I return to you?
He's going to use the gum to send
the coins flying back at me?
You will have to find out for yourself.
Gum, undo.
You shouldn't underestimate me.
Even if the answer is greater than twenty-two,
I'll shoot them all down!
The answer is
enough to kill you.
A lethal pop quiz doesn't
need to be answered.
Forty kilometers until we reach the next town.
I should last that long...
Alluka, you're gonna feel a little zap again.
Okay, it's fine.
Godspeed!
Speed of Lightning!
Very impressive...
If he runs at that speed on pavement,
I won't be able to catch up on my own.
Amane, it's me.
Master Killua is headed for Parasta.
I need you to follow the road.
Canary, come with me.
With my grandmother's motorcycle,
it'll be faster with two riders.
This is...
My grandmother.
Hang on tight.
We'll be using our auras as fuel,
so this will be more tiring than if you were to run.
Be prepared.
Here we go.
Found them.
Seriously?
I know I'm carrying Alluka,
but Speed of Lightning is at full power!
Damn!
If I go this way,
you can't follow on a motorcycle!
What now?
We'll beat him there.
Beat him where?
At Master Killua's speed, it'll take less
than ten minutes to reach Parasta.
It'll take Master Illumi over twenty minutes by car.
What will he do with his ten-minute lead?
Disguise himself?
Wrong. Cute answer...
Though not impossible, I suppose.
What's the first thing Master Killua
will want to do after he loses us?
Contact his friends.
Bingo.
And how can he contact his friends
without us finding out?
Um...
He'll need to check for any
tracing or listening devices,
and use someone else's phone.
That's mere common sense.
Think about what matters in this situation!
We may know where Master Killua is,
but if we can't get near him,
we won't know what he's doing.
So where is he going?
You've figured it out?
Let's go, then!
We've been waiting for you.
Damn, you guys aren't bad.
We've already prepared an airship.
Great, how many?
Huh?
Sounds like you only have one.
Are you serious about this?
Without at least five or six airships heading
to different places, we'll never lose Illumi!
Split up, and make the arrangements.
This airship will take us to our destination.
Is that okay?
Yes.
We'll have to pay for two tickets,
or they'll figure out it's unmanned.
I know that! Do you take me for a fool?
What does this say?
Ask the clerk.
What names should we put the tickets under?
Look, can't you do anything by yourself?
Where's Master Killua?
Crap!
Hey! You were pestering me as a distraction,
weren't you? You helped them escape!
What are you talking about?
We have to follow them!
I'll let you handle that.
Once I've dispatched the other
flights, I'll ride one of them.
If you follow them on the ground,
be sure you aren't followed.
What are you talking about?
If you follow them by air, it'll be more obvious!
That wasn't my plan.
I can serve as a decoy.
And since I plan to join up with Gotoh,
it'll be easier to move by airship.
What is it?
The real you is pretty cute.
I'm sure that Master Killua will
like you more that way.
A-Are you making fun of me?
Nope.
I really mean it.
Gotoh...
Hello? It's me, Killua.
Oh, what happened?
I was getting worried.
I can't get in touch with Gotoh-san.
Got it. I'll try calling him.
Your older brother wants to
kill your younger brother?
Yeah.
Alluka's the only one who can heal Gon.
But Illumi wants to kill Alluka.
Because he thinks that my wish may
end up wiping out the entire family.
We were too late...
Why don't we just wait for
them around the hospital?
The closer we get to the hospital,
the more likely we are to fail.
Killua's friends will be in the vicinity.
And if we just hang around waiting,
they'll realize something isn't right.
Eight... We need more people.
Will you bring in more allies?
But I'm pretty shy...
No, I have no more allies.
Seems like a waste, but I guess I'll use my needles.
That's some nice aura.
If I stick them in someone and give orders,
they'll work hard for me until death.
Though, they usually die from working too hard.
Grant a wish?
That's a pretty scary power.
If segregationists knew about
that, they'd be all over it.
Illumi will probably follow the airships by ground.
My butlers have dispatched seven decoys.
My brother doesn't usually rely on others,
so he'll probably use Needlemen.
Needlemen?
He uses special needles, which carry Nen,
to create soldiers that fight to the death for him.
He sacrifices ordinary civilians to do it.
Illumi's powerful aura enters
the victims through the needles,
so the moment they're pierced,
they turn into vegetables.
Morel, I need you to get some Hunters
to take the Needlemen into custody.
If we have proof that he's harmed
multiple innocent civilians beyond recovery,
then it's okay to hunt him down,
even if he's a pro Hunter, right?
Killua sought this confirmation because of
what the fourth Hunter Commandment said.
Hunter Commandment #4...
A Hunter may never target another Hunter.
However, this does not apply to Hunters
who commit heinous criminal acts.
I believe some of the candidates were talking about
changing the Commandments and Hunter Exam.
If we catch Illumi,
a lot of people who agree with
those views will come forward.
Killua, are you really going to sell your brother out?
I won't forgive anyone who tries to hurt Alluka.
Not even if he's my own brother.
I'll do whatever it takes
to crush him.
I understand.
Teradein and Bushidora will
probably agree to help.
There should be many Hunters
who will gladly lend a hand.
Since you're coming to the city
where the Hunter Association HQ is,
you'll be right under our noses.
But I'll make sure everyone understands
how dangerous our opponent is.
The mission will be to secure the
Needlemen, not to go after Illumi.
Yeah, that's fine.
I've accessed Parasta Airport's flight records.
There are six airships landing within twenty
to thirty kilometers of the hospital.
We don't know where Killua
and his butlers will land.
And Illumi can't pursue what he can't see.
Illumi and the Needlemen will try to
stay in visual range of the airships,
as they follow on the ground.
They will be vulnerable to attack
at a number of points before
they reach Swaldani City, where the hospital is.
So we need to send Hunters to those points.
Our top priority is recovering the Needlemen.
We can confirm if there are needles afterward.
Capture anyone who approaches the airship!
Yes, sir!
Be on your way!
Go!
Hisoka, can you dispose of the fakes for me?
Okay.
I will be busy.
I always knew the fourth Commandment
was fundamentally wrong.
We can't wait for a villain like this to appear!
The Association's honor will be sullied.
The exam needs to be more strict.
If they were required to behave
properly before joining,
we wouldn't have this problem.
So the time has come...
For the three of us, the anti-chairman faction,
to leave the Association.
Heart Is Valuable
Hello, everyone.
Today, I—Teradein—Loupe, and
Bushidora have joined forces.
We three are commonly known
as the anti-chairman faction,
but that is not a name of our choice.
The Hunter souls within us were inherited
from the former chairman, I assure you.
And so, to carry out his will,
we seek to reform the highly versatile team
to which the former chairman belonged,
Seirin Group
the legendary Seirin Group.
Teradein, the leader.
Loupe, the second-in-command.
And I, Bushidora, will serve
as captain of the troops.
In this election, as an expression of our solidarity,
we request that all votes go
to Teradein, the leader.
We hope that everyone who agrees
with our message will vote
for our comrade Teradein.
Now, as we address our message,
we have received trustworthy
information from a reliable source
stating that multiple parties have found
a certain Hunter guilty of many foul crimes.
We are currently pursuing this Hunter.
Ladies and gentlemen,
let us come together to rebuild the
Hunter Association with wisdom and integrity!
And so, the conflict within
the Zoldyck family over Alluka
grows in intensity as it now involves
the Hunter Association chairman election.
Teradein and his allies seek
to control the Association.
As the election continues,
Illumi manages to capture Killua.
Next time: Sin x And x Claw.
﻿5th Election for the 13th Chairman
In the fifth vote in the election
for the 13th chairman,
6) Botobai — 26
7) Mizaistom — 21
8) Morel — 20
9) Biscuit — 18
10) Saccho — 16
11) Linne — 15

14) Sanbica — 3
15) Loupe, Bushidora — 0
Valid Votes: 633 (28 Absentees)

Pariston placed first.
But since he didn't receive
the majority of the valid votes,
1) Pariston — 274 (41.4%)
2) Teradein — 77
3) Cheadle — 63
4) Leorio — 55
5) Ickshonpe — 28
those in the top eight must hold a runoff.
What? Talk about my loss?
Cutie Beauty
I haven't lost.
Our beloved Pariston will bring my dream
of a cutiful Hunter Association to life.
Biscuit Krueger
Yeah, that old man...
I mean, Netero...
I'm sure everyone knows
how crazy he could be.
But there's one thing I can say.
Just like in the battle with the Ants,
you can't escape danger just
by being good all the time!
That's a fact!
Ging Freecss
Saccho Kobayakawa
Well...
I'll continue to support the
Association behind the scenes.
I won't proffer any names,
but I hope you vote for someone worth supporting.
Sanbica Norton
I would like to thank all
those who voted for me...
But please stop...
Linne Hors-d'oeuvre
Sin x And x Claw
Yes, hello?
Somehow,
I managed to obtain a map.
It has routes and destinations for all six airships.
They seem to be on one of
the two remaining airships.
Want me to send a picture?
I'll be using Texture Surprise to
change it a little, though.
It's okay.
An idiot over here was carrying the map, too.
And I already know which airship Killua took.
Okay.
Oh, right... He has a spotter.
Someone's watching me?
I don't think I'm so senile that someone
could tail me when I'm tailing another.
Since the mission began, I've felt eyes on me.
They're quite far away,
yet I can't shake them off.
This is the first time that's happened.
This person must be very good...
Amane, come here!
We're going to fly!
Yes!
Fortunately, it appears that
clouds have come out tonight.
Master Killua is sure to use
that to his advantage.
As expected...
You're late. Let's go!
Yes!
Tsubone's power,
known as Rider's High,
allows her to transform herself
into various different vehicles.
However, the vehicles are
fueled by the rider's aura,
so she cannot use her power alone.
When we're above the clouds,
no one can watch us from the ground,
no matter how strong the scope.
Amane, if there are any suspicious aircraft
around, we'll take them down.
Yes!
Well...
There's still time before either ship will land.
I'll help Hisoka out a bit longer.
Nothing out of the ordinary here.
The target has yet to appear.
We've lost all contact with Point C!
Nothing has happened at Point A.
Should we tell them to send support?
We can't assume that Point A is safe.
Illumi manipulates others with his needles.
He may control that area already.
You're saying he's killed over twenty people?
It doesn't matter how many
amateurs we throw at him.
We should warn the pros who are
going after the Needlemen.
Latun and Kenzaki aren't answering.
What?
The two airships they were
following are in close proximity.
Most likely...
It looks like I must go.
It's a chance to show that I'm worthy
to be Captain of the Seirin Group!
What about the election?
Those who are able should still go.
Even if we exclude everyone who's hunting,
we can still finish in the top four.
We must continue voting in the election.
Even if we can't predict the outcome, I don't
want to manipulate it through absenteeism.
Why don't we hire Association Hunters?
If we show that we're trying to carry on
the spirit of the Hunter Association,
we could win some of the votes
that are defaulting to Pariston.
He's right. We should move immediately!
If everything works out,
the Association Hunters will be killed
and miss the next vote.
If I told him that, I'm sure Teradein would object.
If we can't predict the outcome,
we should force more absentees,
so it will be invalid.
Teradein is too honest,
and Bushidora can't plan well.
Teradein-san has requested Hunters in
compliance with the Association's terms?
Magnificent!
That's wonderful!
Accept the request! Do the job!
You don't need to be concerned about me.
In fact, if there's no limit on the
number of Hunters we can send,
spread the word and take everyone.
If you come across anything you want
to ask or tell me while on the job,
feel free to contact me anytime.
If anything needs to be improved,
we can work it out.
Yes, they make an excellent trio.
I like them...
They're so easy to understand.
6th Election for the 13th Chairman
Total Number of Hunters: 661
The vote's invalid because the turnout was 91.2%.
1) Pariston — 272 (41.1%)
2) Teradein — 73
3) Cheadle — 66
4) Leorio — 58
5) Morel — 53
6) Mizaistom — 44
7) Botobai — 37
8) Ickshonpe — 0
Valid Votes: 603 (58 Absentees)
Turnout: 91.2% (Invalid)
What's going on?
Teradein!
Everyone pursuing the Needlemen was wiped out.
Our members, the camera crew,
and the Association Hunters!
Even Bushidora!
Impossible!
Illumi must have hired dozens of strong soldiers!
More like one.
Since we took flight, I haven't
felt anyone watching us.
Which means we really were being tailed before.
The clouds have cleared up...
Well, since we're this far from
the hospital, it should be fine.
If anyone sees Alluka when we enter the hospital,
Tsubone will say that Alluka's
power has been revealed,
and she'll take us home immediately.
But if I clear the area, that'll only
make it easier for Illumi to act.
Taking this airship to the
hospital would be difficult.
Gotoh's idea to drive a car straight
into the hospital may be best.
Canary?
I can't reach Gotoh.
Neither can I.
Then I need you to tell Hishita and
the rest to send cars immediately
to the following three locations.
I understand.
We've lost the ground pursuit
by flying above the clouds.
We'll be fine until we're in the car.
After that, we have to pick the
best route to the hospital.
Gon...
Hang in there.
Okay... Nice timing, Hishita.
Since we had to loop around, it took longer.
But now we're sixty kilometers
from the hospital.
They can't find us.
Take us to the hospital.
At once.
What's wrong?
There are people in front of the car.
Those...
are Needlemen!
Impossible! How?
Following us should have been impossible!
Was it the car? Did they follow the car?
Hishita, hit the gas!
They're beyond help anyway!
I can't do that, Master Killua.
Not unless Master Illumi orders it.
Wh-What?!
We're completely surrounded.
Impossible...
How can he be here?
Illumi...
How?!
It's impossible...
Unless he knew which airship we were on!
No, that's not right...
Even if he knew which airship,
he couldn't be here.
We flew dozens of kilometers over the clouds.
He couldn't have followed us on the ground!
Kil,
you seem to be hiding something
from me about Alluka.
Do I use Godspeed
to get Hishita out of the car
and use it to escape?
Or do I go back to the airship
and try to escape by air?
If I were alone, those options would work.
But it'd be hard to manage
that and keep Alluka safe.
How did you know we were here?
If I tell you, will you give me Alluka?
Forget it.
I won't ask.
Alluka has an ordinary child's strength.
A single attack from one of the
Needlemen could be lethal.
What do I do?
I have to summon Something.
It's me.
The fool who was completely tricked.
Oh, it's Tsubone!
Your mother can see everything
that I see through this scope.
She probably transmitted the
video to you, Master Illumi.
Bingo. Tsubone served as my spy.
When the clouds cleared,
I felt eyes on me again and realized the truth.
The timing was too perfect.
Ah, so you actually felt us watching...
You're really something.
Well, now you know the truth,
but you can't remove that scope because
Mom ordered you to wear it.
Yes, you're completely right.
Tsubone,
give me the nail from your middle finger.
Yes, absolutely.
Here you are, Master.
Tsubone, give me the nail
from your ring finger.
Yes, that's easy enough.
Tsubone, I appreciate it.
Now, Master Killua...
Make your wish.
Amane and I will take care of the rest.
Please allow me this opportunity to
make amends for impeding your mission.
Are you going to do it?
Fine...
That means when you save Gon,
you'll follow the same process, right?
If you'd sacrifice those two to kill me,
you won't have any problem sacrificing
a bunch of strangers to save Gon.
Rule 5...
The same person can't make
two wishes in a row.
Would it be more fun to kill Alluka,
earning Killua's wrath,
or more fun to spare Alluka and save
Gon, making Illumi my enemy?
Tough call...
If you say yes, I'll be happy to die.
Your inner mission will have succeeded.
It's against the rules for family
members to kill one another,
but the thing that will grant your wish...
isn't family.
Assuming there's a secret rule that
makes rule 5 not apply to Killua...
If my death means no other family
will die, that's acceptable.
Killua will suffer for the rest of his life.
I will live in his heart forever.
Go ahead, then.
I'm offering a deal, Kil...
My death in exchange for your word
that you yourself will make the wish
to save Gon.
Alluka lives while Illumi dies,
but I don't earn Killua's wrath.
So if Gon is healed, I neither gain nor lose anything.
In that case,
I will kill Alluka to earn Killua's wrath,
then take out Killua to earn Illumi's wrath.
That is the best choice...
Something,
heal Tsubone's left hand.
'Kay.
Hand. Hand.
Tsubone, put out your left hand.
Master Killua, but...
Just do it.
Something is skilled at destroying,
but fixing isn't her forte.
When she's fixing, she must touch the target.
But...
'Kay.
Killua, pat my head!
Of course, I will.
That was amazing, Something.
Something is the one who calls me "Killua."
Healing someone is tiring,
so Something must sleep.
But that's it.
Something has never made a cruel
request after healing someone!
Something is kinder than anyone.
The one who's cursed is the one who wishes.
If you refer to Something as an object again,
I won't consider you my brother anymore.
Got it, Kil.
If you can heal Gon without any risk, that's terrific.
But that doesn't change the fact
that Something is dangerous,
and my questions remain unanswered.
Kil, you're still hiding something.
Such as how Milluki's rule 5 doesn't apply to you.
Until you tell me everything,
I won't let Alluka go.
Stupid!
That's why I can't tell you anything.
If you knew the last rule, you'd...
No, all of you...
would put needles in my head again.
Master Killua, I will take you to the hospital.
Captain Bushidora, of the Seirin Group,
was killed in pursuit of the wicked Hunter
that we hoped to bring to justice.
This confirms that demons are hiding among us!
However, I regret to say that the Seirin Group
does not have the power to bring the
Hunter, or Hunters, to justice.
Everyone! This is an urgent matter
that the Association must band
together to resolve at once!
That is why our goal is to ensure
that voter turnout exceeds 95%,
and that the winner has a majority!
Thus, we are currently in negotiations
with Morel, who has strong ties with
the former chairman's faction, in hopes
that he will be our new captain.
At the same time, we are prepared
to reveal the name, face, and abilities
of this demon to prevent further tragedy.
If you agree with our ideals, please...
cast a vote for Teradein!
Oh, uh...
I'm pretty sure I turned you down.
Can't you reconsider?
I agree that I was fairly close
to the former chairman,
and I participated in the Ant extermination.
But I'm not a warrior.
It was determined that my support was required,
given the nature of the operation.
I wouldn't say that I'm strong.
But...
Didn't you watch them introduce the top sixteen?
I'm a Sea Hunter!
I belong in the water. I'm a water man.
I don't belong on land.
Can't you adapt?
And if you're in a hurry to end the election,
you could tell your supporters to vote for Pariston!
Though, I'd rather die than vote for him...
One last thing.
If you release his identity,
you and a bunch of other fools will end up dying.
And don't use the "Seirin Group"
name when you're so weak!
I'm not interested in teaming up with
people who won't heed my warnings,
and I'm not interested in becoming chairman.
I'm done!
7th Election for the 13th Chairman
Total Number of Hunters: 635
1) Pariston 293 (46.1%)
2) Leorio 95
3) Cheadle 87
4) Mizaistom 72
5) Teradein 43 (Death confirmed during voting)
6) Morel 14
7) Botobai, Ickshonpe 0
Valid Votes: 604 (31 Absentees)
Turnout: 95.1%
The results of the seventh vote call
for a runoff between the top four.
Four remain.
Is everything going according to Pariston's plan?
What does it take to move the human heart?
Next time: Approval x And x Coalition.
﻿Do you need something?
I heard that you're leaving tomorrow.
You're abandoning the election and your son?
That bald fool!
Why did he tell her?
Why don't you stay and see this through?
We already know the election's outcome.
I've had my fun.
Meeting that Leorio guy was the best part.
He shows a lot of promise.
What are you talking about?
We're down to four candidates.
We don't know the outcome.
That's what I'm saying.
See? You do understand.
Approval x And x Coalition
I plan on voting for you today.
See ya around.
What in the world are you talking about?
Are you stupid?
I'm saying the outcome will be
that there is no outcome!
Want to know how many days
it'll be before this is over?
How can you possibly know that?
Because you and Mizai are in this to win.
But if you really wanted to win,
you should have tried harder before.
You needed to use any means necessary
during the second or third
votes to secure a majority,
and clear the turnout requirement.
Why are you telling me this now?
It's easy to say whatever you want in hindsight.
If I'd warned you beforehand,
you'd have done the opposite.
You're so difficult!
Well, I don't care if you think
this is hindsight speaking.
You can tell yourself that until the day this ends.
Wait!
What do you want?
I'll do as you say.
What should I do?
You don't sound too happy about it.
I don't know what Pariston is thinking.
How do I beat him?
Except you've never done anything
I've told you to do...
Okay, I'll start with what Pariston's thinking, then.
He doesn't want to win.
But he doesn't want to lose, either.
That's what makes him strong.
What? How can that be?
Yeah, I know.
Common sense tells you that people
who want to win are stronger, right?
Nothing wrong with that. You're right.
And being right makes you predictable.
That goes especially for when you want to win
a game where you're trying to secure votes.
Game?
See? You thought I was being disrespectful, right?
You're mad because you're big on morals,
balance, and sticking to the manual.
Look at me.
You're failing to act like a dog.
You're just being yourself.
Pariston is familiar with both sides
of you, so he knows that.
He knows exactly what you're
thinking and what you'll do next.
And even then, he doesn't want to win.
He's damn good, right?
Then what do I do?
I told you...
If I tell you what to do, you'll never listen.
How many times must we go through this?
Okay, I'll tell you what happens
if the game continues as is.
First, you and Pariston will be the ones
remaining after the next vote.
In the two-candidate vote after
that, first and second will flip.
And that's what will keep happening.
Pariston will probably try
to lower the turnout rate.
The Association Hunters he has
control over will refuse to vote.
Why?
Like I said...
He doesn't want to win or lose.
He'll drag things out until the very last day.
He's just looking to have fun.
He's like Netero and me.
Well, I get bored a lot more quickly...
But he has more patience.
Of the four remaining candidates,
Pariston is the only one
who carries on Netero's will.
You have no right to say that!
You're only jealous of him.
Were you that fond of the dirty old man?
Shut your mouth!
Don't get too full of yourself!
You just have to tell me the day
when this election will end,
you stupid vagabond!
Okay, I can do that...
But before this is over, you
should learn to act in character.
You're impossible to talk to.
The day Netero blew himself up,
one hundred large airships belonging
to the Hunter Association
set off for East Gorteau.
There's no record of their departure.
All records show that they're
in hangars for maintenance.
You had no idea, did you?
You should make friends with
some mechanics and pilots.
What are you talking about?
They're recovering approximately
five thousand cocoons.
Cocoons containing chimera mutants.
They all have the ability to use Nen.
And they're all probably about to hatch.
Pariston plans to have some fun with them,
now that he has such a huge playground.
The day the election ends will be
the day of the next Hunter Exam.
However, if the Commandments are reformed,
the situation will change slightly.
You'll have to figure out the rest yourself.
Aren't you a Hunter?
Okay, we will now hold the eighth vote
for the election of the 13th chairman.
Today, we will start by listening to speeches
from the four remaining candidates.
After some debate among the candidates,
we will move on to the vote.
How did this happen?
Oh, I guess it's my fault...
Now, first,
we have comments from the
candidates who did not qualify.
First, I would like to thank everyone
who supported me. Thank you.
And if possible,
going forward, I would ask those who had
faith in me to give your votes to Cheadle.
The Zodiacs are not united.
However, there are those among
us who share very similar goals.
And the one who shares my goal is Cheadle.
Her desire to maintain balance will lead
the Association in a better direction.
Where you people are now is not
my reality, so do what you want.
Ging!! Don't try to run while you're
ahead!! Get back here!!
We will now begin the speeches
from the candidates.
There is one thing to note.
Everyone who's gathered inside the hall today
will be asked to stay until the 13th
chairman has been selected.
Anyone inside?
Only Tsubone and Canary.
How's Master Alluka?
She's still asleep.
I'm waiting for her to wake up.
It won't be much longer.
Just a little longer, Gon!
It's possible that we will
continue to have multiple ties,
but we've arranged for all necessary provisions,
so you can rest easy repeating the vote as
many times as necessary, be it for hours or days.
Let me repeat myself.
You may not leave this hall until the
13th chairman has been selected.
Now, we'll start with a speech from
the candidate in fourth, Mizaistom.
This is bad.
To eliminate Pariston, I will
serve as a sacrificial lamb.
I'll make this quick.
Of the four candidates on stage,
I believe the one most qualified to be chairman
is Cheadle.
I won't say that I'm not willing
to become chairman.
But it isn't my time.
First, I must train the Hunters under me,
and work to become a Triple Hunter.
I would appreciate it if you'd respect my
wishes, and help end this election today.
That's all I have to say.
What should I say?
Next, we have the candidate
in third, Cheadle-san.
All yours.
I'll also make this quick.
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe the 13th chairman
should be Leorio.
That's all I have to say.
What is Cheadle up to?
I'm not gonna be elected.
I don't even want to be elected.
But I guess I should say what I want.
My focus right now isn't this election, anyway.
Okay... Thank you.
Next, we have the candidate
in second, Leorio-san.
All yours.
You aren't smiling anymore, Pariston.
I won't let you have your way!
Huh?
Leorio-san, could you please speak?
Leorio-san!
Damn it, Leorio!
Are you asleep?
I'll strangle you!
Ah! Me?
Nope, I'm drawing a blank.
What am I doing up here?
Forget it.
In that case...
I'll just say what's on my mind.
If elected chairman, I'll treat the
Association like it belongs to me!
My first command will be to order
all of you to help save Gon!
This isn't where I should be right now.
Well, it isn't like I could help
Gon if I were with him...
He's... Gon is fighting for his life now.
He's a buddy. A friend.
But I only found out recently.
While I was studying for myself,
drinking, moving from place to place,
jerking off, entertaining women,
and surfing the Internet...
He was fighting for others.
Alongside the former chairman and their allies.
One of them has put his life
on the line to save Gon.
All I could do was talk to Gon.
That's all I can do.
So if I become chairman,
I won't stop talking to you.
Please help save Gon!
Use your heads!
If you have an idea, take action!
If there's something I can do, tell me.
I'll do anything!
Ging...
I think I understand why you
didn't avoid his punch.
Even from that moment,
you saw something in him.
I'm fine with having him as chairman.
Damn, I think I said more than I needed to.
Forget the part about jerking off.
I'm done.
If we're there to support him,
I'm sure he'll make a good chairman.
Finally, we have the candidate
in first place, Pariston-san.
All yours.
Everyone, please be quiet!
It's over, Pariston.
It doesn't matter what you say.
My eighty-seven votes,
Mizai's seventy-two votes,
and the fifty-seven independent votes
will be added to Leorio's ninety-five.
That gives him three hundred, eleven votes.
He'll have over fifty percent of the vote.
The 13th chairman will be Leorio.
Everyone, please quiet down.
Refrain from using mobile phones.
Um, in a moment, I'm going to get loud.
Everyone, you can continue
talking on the phone.
This is the true Hunter spirit.
Once this election ends, I promise to
do everything I can to help Gon-kun.
However, we must keep that matter
separate from the election.
Of the remaining candidates,
the one most qualified to be chairman
is Mizaistom-san.
Heart Is Valuable
There's something I've learned
after serving as Chairman Netero's
Vice Chairman for three years.
There are three conditions a chairman needs.
First is combat ability.
This is an absolute necessity,
given our job requirements.
During the recent crisis, this was evident.
Second is experience.
Wisdom comes from experience!
As a Hunter, you can never have
too many years of experience.
Why?
Why do I feel so irritated when he's talking?
And the third is caliber.
I know why...
I understand him.
He never says what he truly thinks.
There aren't too many people who make you think
that the Association would be in good
hands if they were chairman.
Cheadle lacks combat ability.
Leorio-san lacks experience.
Stop... Don't let emotions get the best of me.
And I lack all three!
Hey, you were supposed to laugh.
I need to figure out what he's after.
I believe that Mizaistom-san is the only
one possessing all three qualities.
One hundred and twenty of Pariston's two
hundred ninety are Association Hunters.
Thirty of the votes come from
the investigative and administrative
departments he heads.
Pariston is able to control those votes
as he likes without any signs or speeches.
We will now move on to the
debate among the candidates.
Pariston's speech will create a split
among the independents, who were all
most likely leaning toward Leorio.
I'm guessing this is how it will look.
Leorio: Leorio votes, Cheadle votes, Morel votes, Teradein votes
Pariston: Association Hunter and Administrative
Department votes, Pariston personal votes
Mizaistom: Mizai votes, Pariston votes
Cheadle: Mizai votes
But that would just push the
election out another vote,
which matches our goal.
Will something change during the debate?
Fine, then... I'll figure this out myself!
Can I go first, then?
No, I go first.
As I said earlier, I'm not interested
in becoming chairman.
No, you said that you wouldn't say
you're not willing to become chairman.
However, this isn't about what you want, Mizai-san.
What matters is how the voters feel.
Sometimes, there are situations where a job
can only be done by a certain person.
That's where caliber comes in.
You shouldn't be talking about how you feel.
Stop the petty tricks, and let the voters decide.
You have the nerve to say that?
But why is he pushing Mizai?
Does he expect us
to let greed get the better of
us and push Mizai to second?
That will never happen!
Because the votes for Leorio
are primarily independent.
If Leorio loses, they're likely to swing to Pariston.
But if Leorio remains,
the votes previously cast for myself
and the openly anti-Pariston Mizai
will go to Leorio.
He'll hold on to Teradein's anti-Zodiac votes,
and the Morel votes are also anti-Pariston.
Meaning that they'll never switch to Pariston.
Got it, Mizai?
Yeah, I understand.
Defeating Pariston is the ultimate goal.
As a Crime Hunter, I trust my instinct.
There's no proof, and it's entirely possible
that his hands are clean.
However...
He definitely has underground ties.
We can't let him run rampant within
the Association any longer.
Since it appears that not even
Netero could rein him in...
This election is where we must...
...tear down Pariston's system.
And so, the eighth vote for
the 13th chairman begins.
The votes fly.
Is he defeated?
As Killua takes Something's hand,
everything approaches its end.
Next time: Defeat x And x Reunion.
﻿Please help save Gon!
Use your heads!
If you have an idea, take action!
If there's something I can do, tell me.
I'll do anything!
Defeat x And x Reunion
The results of the eighth chairman election
were promptly counted by Beans.
Now, please take a look at the result of
the eighth election for the 13th chairman!
Wow!
Eighth Election for the 13th Chairman
1) Leorio 282 (44.4%)
2) Pariston 250
3) Mizaistom 58
4) Cheadle 16
Turnout: 95.4%
This puts Leorio in first place!
For the first time, Pariston hasn't
finished in first place...
However, the first place vote-getter, Leorio,
received only 44.4% of the vote.
That was below the 50% requirement,
which means we'll finally have a run-off
between the top two vote-getters.
Are they serious about this?
Then I'm gonna do whatever the hell I want.
Oh, it's Brother.
Morning.
Did you sleep well?
Uh-huh.
Where are we?
The hospital.
My friend is here, sleeping. He's very sick.
I want to help get him
on his feet again.
You want Something to take over.
Boo! Just when I was able to spend time with you!
Don't worry.
Like I told you...
We'll be together from now on.
And that's a promise.
Please help me.
I knew it.
Killua is the one person who doesn't
have to follow the rules.
Though I'll have to check
whether it's specific to Killua or something
that happens after a wish is used to heal.
Okay, I'll do it.
Either way, the power to destroy and fix
can become a powerful tool
if the user can be tamed.
His utter lack of humanity and wicked ambition
deviate even from the path of an assassin.
How tragic...
When he was being controlled, he suffered less.
Alluka is only awake when Something is asleep.
She spends less time as Alluka than one would think.
The time after Something's requests
aren't met and people die,
until Something makes the next level-1 request...
Or the time when request-making is paused
after someone leaves Something
before her three requests are complete...
Or the time after Something fixes and falls asleep,
until someone else makes a wish
to Alluka and has it granted...
Making this the last wish and never
wishing to Something again
would be the best thing that could happen.
Hand... Hand...
Please,
Something...
Please heal Gon!
'Kay.
Such incredible power...
What's happening inside?
Who's doing this?
What is this?
I've never felt anything like this before.
Are you serious? Are you serious?
Then I'm going to do whatever I want.
Magnificent.
I want this.
This...
belongs to me.
Then let me ask the two remaining candidates
if they have anything they want to say.
If not, we will proceed with the final vote.
It's futile.
It doesn't matter what you have to say.
Well, I have a feeling that
this election is already over,
but I would like to ask Leorio-san a question.
Can you answer this question for me again?
What will you do if you become chairman?
Leorio-san, can you please
give us your answer again?
What will you do if you become chairman?
Save Gon!
And I'll make all of you help me!
That's all.
This would have been the perfect time,
but I'm not God.
In that case, do you have any
plans for shuffling personnel
or restructuring the organization?
Of course not!
I don't even know why I'm
standing here right now!
Naturally...
Those are all the questions I have.
It's futile, Pariston.
Everyone was aware of those answers
when they voted for Leorio.
His supporters applauded because they
have every intention of backing him!
Do you have any questions for me?
No! Let's just get this over with!
I understand.
Then I move for an emergency council.
Huh?
Er, what are you saying?
An emergency council.
In accordance with the Eighth
and Ninth Hunter Commandments,
I move for a vote of confidence.
The topic will be a revision of the Hunter
Commandments and the Hunter Exam.
First, I propose that we abolish the
current Hunter Exam system.
If you agree, please vote "yea."
If you disagree, please vote "nay."
Hold it right there!
During the Zodiac council, we decided
the Ten Commandments weren't to be touched!
That isn't relevant right now!
No.
You're wrong, stupid tiger!
You're absolutely right.
The council reached an 11-1 majority decision.
I was the only one in favor of
revising the Ten Commandments.
If Cheadle-san or Mizaistom-san were
standing on the stage now,
I would have deferred to the council and
kept my mouth shut until the election ended.
But both of them are out of the running.
And Leorio-san has stated that he
has no plan for the Association!
This is the only time
I can express my opinion as vice chairman,
and not as a member of the Zodiacs.
Don't you understand, Kanzai-san?
This is the only chance I will ever get!
Of course, I could use the Eighth Commandment
to override the council's decision
and force the matter to a vote.
But I wanted to avoid that.
The Zodiacs are something precious
that the former chairman left us.
Hey, if you say something stupid,
he'll pay you back ten times over.
Honestly, part of me wishes to let this
matter die without making waves.
However, the late Teradein-san and
Bushidora-san made an excellent point.
The Third and Fourth Commandments
are suffering gravely as a result
of the current exam process!
He doesn't want to win.
He doesn't want to lose, either.
You're right...
He's a spiteful person!
He doesn't care about winning or losing,
so with nothing to gain or lose, he can
always stay dispassionate and calm,
while he manipulates others and plays the rules
against us in the worst way possible.
May I say something?
Yes, what is it?
If Leorio wins, I volunteer to serve as an advisor.
I promise to conduct a comprehensive review of
the Ten Commandments and
Hunter Exam at that point.
I won't let you grab any of the Teradein votes!
I'll counter every point you've made!
To everyone who's voting for
the potential Leorio shows,
but who's concerned about
how he will serve initially,
I will quell those concerns, even if it
requires me to leave the Zodiacs.
Hey, hey, hey!
I have no idea what you people are talking about.
But I'm in a hurry to save Gon
as quickly as possible!
Leorio!
Gon!
Damn!
You had me so worried!
Leorio!
I'm so glad!
So glad!
Did I l look that bad?
Bad doesn't even begin to describe it!
Leorio, stop.
He's healed now. Isn't that enough?
Yeah, you're right.
Everyone was worried about you.
Thank you... Thank you.
He got us.
Pariston wanted Leorio to be his final opponent!
Leorio no longer has the motive or
support to become chairman.
You become chairman!
Who's the bald guy?
Leorio, you can't tell Gon that Killua healed him.
Huh? Why not?
You can't tell him!
For Killua's sake, promise not to tell him.
O-Okay, got it.
Pariston, when?
When did you predict that this would happen?
Huh?
No, no...
I don't have the ability to predict anything.
This was pure coincidence.
Please tell me. I want to know.
It hurts to admit this, but I've been defeated.
It was when Ging-san said he
would run for chairman...
What?
After he said he would run,
I asked a question to provoke him.
And he responded that Gon-kun wouldn't die, right?
Go visit him.
He isn't going to die.
In that moment,
I could see the scene that
just transpired before us.
Well, I anticipated Ging-san
and I would stand on stage,
and Ging-san would ultimately win.
At least, in my vision.
First, since Ging-san said Gon-kun wouldn't die,
I knew that meant there was a way to heal him.
And that if he became part of the
election, I would never win.
Do you understand?
That was the moment I was defeated.
But Ging-san gave up on the election,
then Leorio-san arrived, and hit him.
When he stood on stage
and talked about his friends risking
their lives to save Gon-kun,
I finally saw the complete picture.
I was assured of my victory a moment ago,
when I felt that immense power.
I could sense that Gon-kun's friends had saved him.
All that remained was to delay
the vote until he arrived.
Oh, I'll retract the earlier motion,
so there's nothing for you to worry about.
That was all the information you had?
You put your trust in someone
you'd never met before?!
I trust Ging-san as an enemy.
And these are the friends that
Ging-san trusted to save his son.
I trust them.
Why wouldn't I?
Run for chairman!
I'll vote for you!
Get on stage and say something!
Speech! Speech!
Man, I don't know what to do.
Ging?
This is bad.
But, well, this was always gonna happen...
Gon has finally caught sight of Ging's back.
What will he say to him?
Next time: Chairman x And x Release.
﻿Ging?
Chairman x And x Release
Yo.
Ging!
I'm sorry!
It was my fault...
Because of me, Kite
turned into a little girl!
I h-heard he was captured by the enemy.
Yeah, I was with Kite...
Then Kite told me to run away,
and Pitou showed up.
Kite lost his arm, I was knocked out,
and then we trained...
Shoot got Kite out of the Ants' nest,
but it wasn't Kite...
They did all kinds of horrible things!
When I met Pitou again,
Pitou said that Kite was already dead!
Okay, I get it!
Well, I don't get it, but just have a seat, okay?
U-Uh... Er...
Let's calm down.
We should both try to calm down...
It was because I insisted...
on having my way!
Oh, um...
A-A-Anyway...
Just calm down first.
Ging is...
Ging is actually flustered.
I should have
been the one who died!
Gon.
That isn't true.
He took you along because he believed in you.
He told you to run because he'd
underestimated the enemy.
If he hadn't thought you capable,
he wouldn't have let you accompany
him, no matter what you'd said.
It was his fault that he misjudged the enemy.
But—
I know.
You're also at fault for being too weak!
You should feel responsible.
Don't make the same mistake.
And you should apologize to Kite, not to me!
You didn't clearly say if he's dead or alive,
but either way, you should apologize!
Yeah.
When apologizing to a friend, there's a rule.
Do you know it?
Huh?
No, what is it?
You promise to do things differently next time.
And you keep that promise, no matter what.
Uh-huh.
Okay, get going!
Yeah!
Ging?
Can I...
talk to you some more later?
That might be difficult.
I'm a busy man...
That's crap, Ging!
Aren't you his father?
How cold can you be?!
I know about Greed Island!
You never went to see Gon after he cleared it!
Too bashful or something?
All you you, shut up!
It's none of your business!
You're a jerk, Ging!
You should apologize to Gon!
Promise him you'll act more like a father!
Hell, you don't have the right
to say you're his father!
Make up your minds!
You can all screw yourselves!
You should have Leorio punch you again!
Yeah, just shut up!
Fine, then...
I'll be waiting, so get going!
How stupid do you think we are?
You take him there!
Aren't you his father?
Okay, fine!
I'll take you all on!
If you have a problem with
what I'm doing, bring it on!
You're all against me? Okay!
That's fine by me!
Everyone!
Quiet down!
The election isn't over yet.
Yes, I still haven't given up.
A new last chance has appeared!
Gon-kun—
Go ahead, then.
Due to the circumstances, no one
can leave until the election is over.
You're in a hurry, aren't you?
But this will be the final vote.
Once you vote, you'll be allowed to leave.
If you tell us your choice right now,
everyone here will accept that as a valid vote.
Between myself, Pariston, and Leorio-san,
whom do you believe is most
fit to become chairman?
I should mention that the
former chairman, Netero,
is taking an extended vacation
after defeating the Ant King.
How can you say such a thing?
If Gon picks Leorio after his dramatic arrival,
everyone may get caught up in
the heat of the moment again
and vote for Leorio.
Chairman?
Leorio's running for chairman?
No! See, some stuff happened...
Gon-kun,
you can rely on your gut.
Be true to your heart,
and pick one of us.
Uh... Then,
I'll pick Pariston-san!
Huh?
Isn't Leorio-san your friend?
Shouldn't you pick him?
Nope, because Leorio wants
to become a doctor,
so he can't be chairman!
Of course!
Now I've been completely defeated.
Thank you, Gon-kun.
Then let's begin the vote.
Oh, sorry.
I'm going with Gon.
My vote goes to Pariston.
Leorio...
I know.
Ging!
I'm going now!
Yeah.
Is that all you have to say, you idiot?
At least say, "See you later"!
Where's your common sense?
Ging's snapped!
Someone stop this negligent jerk of a father!
Heart Is Valuable
That's impossible!
Zodiacs, don't just stand there
and smile! Do something!
I guess, in his own way, Ging's popular.
Yeah, I guess so...
Hey, Gon!
I remembered something.
I'm the one who taught Kite how to use Nen.
And I taught him his techniques.
There's a number that his
Crazy Slots won't bring up unless
he's adamant about not dying!
If he's still alive, that's probably why.
He would never consider dying in your place.
So don't mess up your apology.
Or he'll smack you again!
Got it!
I'm off, then!
Yeah! I'll be waiting!
Again?
Ging...
Ninth Election for the 13th Chairman
Total Number of Hunters: 635
1) Pariston 458 (72.1%)
2) Leorio 157
Turnout: 96.8%  Valid Votes: 615
Hello, everyone.
I am your 13th chairman, Pariston.
And I have an important announcement.
I, Pariston, name Cheadle-san as vice chairman,
and resign as chairman.
Okay, then.
I didn't see that coming.
How long must you make fools of us?!
Come back here!
I didn't become vice chairman because
I wanted to become chairman.
I just wanted to hinder the chairman.
When I said silly things to tease him,
Netero-san always looked so happy...
I really wanted to play with him some more.
I recommend that you reform the Hunter
Exam and Commandments quickly.
Cheadle-san, if the Association becomes
a dull place under your leadership,
I'll get serious about toying with you.
Leorio, where's Killua?
Huh?
Oh, I don't know.
He isn't answering his phone.
It sounds like he was traveling,
looking for a way to save you.
Well, once we contact him,
I'm sure he'll come see you.
I need to apologize to Killua.
When I was fighting the enemy, I got confused,
and I said terrible things to him.
I'm sorry, too.
Huh?
Why are you apologizing?
Well, sorry that I couldn't do anything
when you guys were in trouble.
Huh? What do you mean?
I don't get it.
Yeah, I'm really sorry.
The requests following a wish for a computer
should be more severe than playing
dead and a pat on the head.
When I heard Milluki's report,
that was the first thing that seemed off.
And when the two-choice wish resulted
in a simple kiss on the cheek,
it demanded fingernails, a far too heavy price.
Assuming that the fingernails were
the price for the computer,
Wish                                            Request
that would match the balance between
wishes and requests seen previously.
If my theory is correct,
playing dead and the pat on the head
weren't requests from Something.
Thus, the two-choice wish didn't require a payment.
Why was that the case?
There are two possibilities.
One, because the wish was simple enough
that Something's power wasn't required.
Two,
because it wasn't a wish.
However, there's still an unresolved question here.
If playing dead and the pat on the head
weren't requests from Something...
They were requests from Alluka, not Something.
Killua claims that Something calls him "Killua,"
and the request to play dead was made to "Brother."
Thus, the one who calls Killua "Brother" is Alluka.
If the request came from Alluka,
then Something wasn't awake,
and Killua shouldn't have been
able to make the two-choice wish.
However, Something responded to Killua's wish.
The hint to resolving this contradiction
lies in the wording Killua used.
When making the two-choice wish,
Killua was not asking.
He was commanding.
It makes sense that a command
would work differently than a wish,
and would not require a payment upon completion.
Those are my conclusions.
What do you think?
I'll get to the point.
I'm the one who can use Something's power,
effectively and safely, for the Zoldyck family.
As it stands, Alluka is no more than
a spirit locked forever in one room.
But if I control him with you at his side,
at the very least, I can guarantee his freedom.
Brother...
I'll protect Alluka.
Kil, you need to learn your place.
Something, wake up.
'Kay.
Kil, this is your last chance.
Let me have Something—
Something!
Send Illumi back home!
'Kay.
Teleportation...
For real?
Oh, you were all watching?
That's amazing... He's invincible.
If Killua issues a command,
there is no need to worry about requests.
This means that turning Killua into
my puppet is worth any price.
Tsubone, Amane...
Can you leave us alone for a moment?
If you don't leave on your own,
I'll have to issue Something a command.
Killua, pat my head...
Something is doing this because
she wants me to praise her.
I don't want to use her by issuing commands.
So please...
Killua...
Killua!
Killua!
Killua...
Something...
Killua, pat my head.
You can't come out anymore.
I love Killua.
You can't come out, Something.
I love Killua.
I love Killua!
You can't!
Never come out again!
Got it?
'Kay...
Alluka is free now.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Something.
I'm sorry...
Alluka?
Brother?
Yep, it's your big—
Did you make Something cry?
Huh?
Er, well...
She's still hunched over, crying!
Apologize to her!
But...
Apologize!
If you're nice to me, you have to
be nice to Something, too!
If you're going to protect me,
you have to protect Something, too!
If you're mean to Something, I'll hate you!
Alluka, thank you.
I guess I was still under Ill-nii's control.
But everything's okay now.
Can you tell Something to come out?
Something, I'm sorry.
I was wrong.
I'm sorry!
I was scared of Ill-nii,
and I couldn't defy him.
So I did what he said, and I hated it.
When I realized he might force you
to do bad things, too, I got really scared...
For Alluka's sake, I lied to myself,
and I said mean things to you.
I'm really sorry!
Something,
I'll protect you.
We'll always be together!
Don't listen to wishes from anyone else anymore!
I'll pat you on the head whenever you want!
So would you please come out again?
'Kay...
Something,
will you forgive me for being a
bad big brother?
'Kay.
I...
love Killua.
Tsubone, I've rescinded the restriction on Killua.
Please let him know.
Yes, I understand.
His first friend.
Too many memories to speak of.
A new journey.
Next time: Salvation x And x Future.
﻿Something,
will you forgive me for being a
bad big brother?
'Kay.
I...
love Killua.
Don't make the same mistake.
And you should apologize to Kite, not to me!
You didn't clearly say if he's dead or alive,
but either way, you should apologize!
When apologizing to a friend, there's a rule.
Do you know it?
Huh?
No, what is it?
You promise to do things differently next time.
And you keep that promise, no matter what.
Uh-huh.
Salvation x And x Future
She had red hair just like yours.
I shot her because
I knew that the scumbags pursuing her
enjoyed keeping their prey alive to toy with.
After my rebirth as an Ant,
I realized that I was doing the
same things I'd done before.
Before I was reborn this way,
my job was to get rid of people.
When ordered to, I pulled the trigger.
I spent the rest of my time yelling at people.
It was a job anyone could do.
A ridiculous cycle that continues even after rebirth.
I wanted to give her an escape from that cycle.
I didn't know exactly how it all worked,
but...
I felt that if I let them capture her,
torture her, then kill her,
the cycle would repeat itself.
A dull life in the middle of nowhere,
but one lived in peace and quiet...
Until that life was suddenly ended
by mindless violence.
I pulled the trigger
with a prayer that she would escape that cycle.
Regardless of my actions,
the Queen ate hundreds of humans.
And when they were reborn, only a few
could remember their prior lives.
It's possible that most of the human
souls managed to safely escape.
But I wanted to do something.
I wanted to feel like I was helping them escape.
If you're inside that body instead of her,
that probably means she escaped,
and I still haven't run into an Ant
who's told me I killed them in their prior life.
Perhaps they were all able to escape.
Before all this happened, I didn't believe
in the human soul's existence.
I believed that humans had
the same worth as flies or fleas,
and that they only lived and then died.
That the ego was nothing more
than a bug that arose because the human
brain was slightly more complex.
That there was nothing after death.
Our bodies simply decomposed,
turned to dust, and scattered.
I believed those tiny fragments had no purpose.
But now, here I am.
And I'm repeating the cycle.
My appearance is completely different,
but I'm doing the same stupid things as before.
It made me think.
I may be a fool, but I won't deny
the things that I know now.
And I don't want to ignore the
things I don't understand.
I died.
I died, and my body was broken into tiny pieces.
But that wasn't the end.
The fragments that I believed were
too small to retain any meaning
possessed a power I could have never imagined.
Particles no larger than pollen from our perspective
have enough energy to impact our health
tens or hundreds of millions of years later.
And our DNA, which is even smaller,
contains the vast amount of information that
comprises us, all within a double helix.
And that infinitesimally small
size is a necessity for
the birth of the enormous space
known as the universe.
Just because something is small does
not mean it produces less energy.
The soul is probably small, but it has
enough energy to repeat the cycle.
Does that mean I was reborn to continue that cycle?
I don't know what the future holds.
So this is nothing more than
speculation on my part,
but something inside told me that I
mustn't repeat the same things again.
I'm guessing that I'm forced
to repeat all of this because
there was something I failed to provide
my soul with while I was alive.
You know how the body
moves more slowly without
the soul's encouragement...
In my case, I've always been driven by the thought
that I can't let things stay this way.
I know it isn't right.
I will repeat the cycle,
while thinking that I have to change things.
Because I made the wrong choice.
My target shouldn't have been that girl.
It should have been the ones pursuing her.
It's no big deal.
It just means I was the biggest scumbag of all.
The price for cleansing a tainted
soul was too heavy,
so I avoided that.
While selfishly praying that her soul would escape,
I was desperate to avoid getting hurt myself.
I shot her to protect myself.
And now, I'm trying to save myself again
by confessing my sins to you,
the one who inherited her appearance.
Really...
I'm a hopeless case.
I appreciate your listening to my story.
Wait. Don't run away.
You come with me.
Forever.
You'll stay with the person you shot,
living life the only way you can.
This is your duty.
You have no choice.
No one will allow you to take your own life
and hit the reset button.
You must live and apologize to me every day.
I'll keep you so busy, you'll never have time
to worry about what's right or wrong.
You will apologize to me
and do the work I tell you to do,
as you devote your life to me.
If you forget your current resolve and slip,
I will kill you.
So you can focus on living.
Kite, you have a visitor.
Let them in.
Kite?
Yeah.
Sorry.
Come. Sit.
Sorry for what?
I wasn't able to fight by your side.
I wasn't
strong enough.
But...
Next time, I'll protect you!
It sounds like you did some
crazy stuff to defeat Pitou.
Yeah, I almost died...
However, that doesn't change the fact
that you defeated an enemy I couldn't.
I suppose I can soothe my ego by telling myself
that my judgment was correct.
But I wouldn't be here now without
help from Killua and everyone else.
I didn't make it here by myself.
It appears that we both needed more training.
I heard that you met Ging-san.
Did you talk to Ging?
Yeah.
You should go back to him.
I understand what you wanted to say.
I'm glad you came to see me.
If I need help, I promise to let you know.
Say hi to Killua for me.
We're friends now.
So right now, go back to Ging-san.
Okay.
Sorry.
Sorry for what?
I was trying to take the easy way out
by running away from everything.
No matter the pain, I will keep living.
So when I die, I'll feel I did the best I could.
Ging!
I'm waiting atop the World Tree.
I tried to stop him...
Yeah, he didn't say that he
would wait for me here...
It's huge!
This is definitely the tallest tree in the world.
The World Tree stands at the city's center,
at a height of 1,784 meters.
Humans are still unable to build a taller structure.
Climbing the tree is not forbidden,
but you must pay a fee and sign a written agreement.
You can reach the 500-meter
point by elevator or stairs,
but after that, you'll be risking your life.
Every year, around 3,000
people attempt the climb,
but 94% fail to reach the 1,000-meter
point, and turn back.
Another 4% are forced to pay an extremely
pricey fee to be rescued from the tree,
and another 1% fall and die.
Which means that, each year,
only about 30 people make it
to the top and return safely.
So...
This is as far as we're going.
Yeah.
Be careful.
Yeah.
Killua, thank you for everything.
Yeah.
Well,
after you told me you would defeat Pitou alone
and that it was none of my business,
I was pretty depressed!
I'm really sorry...
Brother!
Well, you apologized.
And I think I can say I'm only here with Alluka
now because of the time I spent with you.
She's the one who healed you.
Huh?! Is that true?
Why are you telling me now?
You should have told me sooner!
Sorry.
We don't want too many people knowing about this.
You know, it's sort of a complicated family thing...
Come with me!
Alluka, can you tell Something to come out?
Yeah.
She has the power to grant any wish I make.
Any wish?
Because of that power,
she was locked up in our house.
But thanks to you, she's outside now.
And I'm prepared to spend the
rest of my life protecting her.
We should be the ones thanking you.
'Kay.
N-No way...
I should be thanking you!
This is no good. If we stay here any longer...
Yeah.
I'll be traveling to all kinds of places with Alluka.
I'll e-mail you from time to time.
Me, too.
If anything comes up, let me know.
I'll do the same.
Yeah, I will.
Since you owe me a lot...
Say hi to your dad for me.
Yep.
I want to go with you, but I have to watch Alluka.
And you haven't had a chance to talk alone yet.
See you around.
After I've had my brother all to
myself for a while, I'll set him free.
Will you hang out with him then?
Hold on!
I'm the one choosing to hang out with him!
Isn't she a great sister?
Sorry, but as far as I'm concerned,
you're in second place.
Kite said that no matter where we go,
we'll always be friends!
Yeah!
Bye!
Later!
Next time: Past x And x Future.
I'll introduce you to Ging eventually!
Yeah, that's a promise.
So until we meet again!
Yeah!
﻿He abandoned you when you were still just a baby.
But you still want to...
He was willing to abandon his own kid for it.
That's how amazing it is to be a Hunter!
You really are his son...
The last test to be accepted
by Ging-san is to find him.
It's a task more difficult than any Hunt.
As far as I know, he's the greatest Hunter there is.
There's something that I want.
He never told me what it
was that he wanted.
Catch me if you can.
You are a Hunter, aren't you?
Ging...
Past x And x Future
You want to climb the tree?
No one under the age of eighteen
can go beyond this point.
Unless you have some special
license or certification...
A pro Hunter?
At your age?
Excuse me, then.
Go right ahead.
But I'll need you to sign this first.
Even a president would have to sign it.
It's just the usual thing that says you
don't care if you die during the climb.
Here's some advice!
Don't trust any of the grips or footholds
left behind by previous climbers.
Those who make it to the top
usually do it bare-handed.
That's how the guy who's at
the top right now did it.
Got it! Thanks!
Well, if you feel you're in trouble,
just press that button.
Our rescue team is skilled.
If you can hold on to the tree for ten minutesâ€”
He fell?!
Hey!
Hey!
He's already up there?
I still have a long way to go...
This tree is incredible.
I can entrust myself to it.
The moment my fingers touch it,
I can feel that there's life there,
and that it flows throughout the entire tree.
I can do this!
So long as I heed the tree's whispering as I climb...
Help...
Help me...
Almost there.
The top looks funny.
They're huge!
That scared me...
Hi!
Yo.
I was tired of waiting.
Ging...
How long did it take you to get
here from the 500-meter point?
Uh...
Around twenty minutes?
Well, I guess that's acceptable for your first time...
Eat up.
Yep!
Beautiful view, right?
On overcast days, it's like a sea of clouds.
Yeah!
Hey, Ging...
Hmm?
Can I ask you something?
Sure. I might not give you an answer, though.
What is it that you want?
That which I can't see in front of me right now.
That which you can't see in front of you?
I wanted to become a Hunter because...
Shut up!
I wanted to become a Hunter because,
at the time, it was the most practical way
to get into the place I wanted to go.
That place was used as a certain
royal family's burial ground.
To enter, you had to belong to
a trustworthy organization,
and to agree never to speak of it.
And you had to pay all expenses out of pocket.
In other words, you couldn't really explore it at all.
You won't find anyone willing to spend
the resources and receive nothing in return.
But I saw it as my chance.
If I became a trusted pro Hunter,
getting the money wouldn't be a problem.
When I turned fifteen,
I set up a special nonprofit organization
to explore and repair the tomb.
Before that, I'd spent the two
years after getting my license
surfing archaeology buffs' websites and blogs online.
To create the nonprofit, I needed about ten oddballs
who didn't need money or fame,
but only wanted to know the truth,
and who could be trusted to keep secrets.
I'm always going after what I need.
I'm so focused, I stop caring about
the ultimate goal that lies beyond.
Too hard to understand?
Then I guess I'll keep going.
The people I recruited online and
befriended in offline meetings
were all older than me.
They were regular office workers,
graduate students, and job-hoppers.
After I told them my background and plan,
they helped with the various tasks
to create the nonprofit,
and they even gave donations
from what little money they had.
When our dream was realized and
we stepped inside for the first time,
the best part for me
wasn't when I finally witnessed the truth of the tomb.
It was when I looked
at my colleagues' faces and shook their hands.
To this day, they still work for the
nonprofit with zero compensation,
providing me with viable information.
The secret of the tomb
was nothing compared to the relationships I built.
What was truly important came
to me before what I wanted.
And now?
Huh?
What are you after now?
Right now?
It'll take some time to explain...
Gon,
what is this tree we just climbed?
Huh? It's the World Tree.
That's right.
Down below, how did they describe the tree?
At 1,784 meters, it's the world's tallest tree.
Technically, that's right.
But the truth is that this tree
is a young sapling that's stopped growing.
A World Tree that
didn't receive enough nutrition,
and could only grow this tall.
A real World Tree
would take in magma,
embed its roots in the mountains,
and continue to grow after leaving the atmosphere.
Outside this world.
This world?
The world map that you're familiar with.
The Ants that you and the chairman fought
were a non-native species from outside this world.
That's the truth they don't teach you in school.
Adults with common sense
choose not to go near Pandora's Box.
In other words, the world that we know
is nothing but a small part of a much bigger world.
There are records showing that a chosen few,
from a select time and place,
were able to make it outside.
Understand now?
I still want the same thing I always have.
Something that I can't see in front of me.
There are many requirements to go outside.
At least four are required before
you can even start the journey.
Authorization,
the means,
qualification,
a contract.
I still haven't obtained a single one.
But I'm in no rush.
I'm enjoying the journey.
So if our paths happen to cross in the future...
You should enjoy the little detours.
To the fullest.
Because that's where you'll find the things
more important than what you want.
Oh!
Ging...
Here.
Kite asked me to return this to you.
Oh, okay.
The scar's still on my shoulder.
See? Right here.
And then, there was a huge boom!
And what popped out was
another coffin, just this big.
They're called the Testing Gates,
and you have to open them to go inside.
Marshal
Spy
You should enjoy the little detours.
To the fullest.
Because that's where you'll find the things
more important than what you want.
